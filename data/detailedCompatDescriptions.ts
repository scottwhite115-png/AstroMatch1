  "rat": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rat— Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Quick minds, shared nerves",
      "description": "Two Rats together create a sharp, alert partnership that notices changes in money, mood, and opportunity fast. You're both good at adapting, saving when needed, and spotting chances early. The stress comes from worry and subtle competition over who decides, who controls resources, or who plans better. This stays strong when you agree clearly on goals and treat each other as allies, not rivals."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rat × Ox— Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Quietly strong team",
      "description": "Rat and Ox form a Liu He (六合) bond known for reliability and long-term building. Ox brings patience, staying power, and a willingness to shoulder heavy work; Rat brings timing, ideas, and a keen eye for risk and advantage. Together you're well suited to paying off debts, growing savings, or slowly improving your base. Respecting Ox's slower pace and trusting Rat's instincts about when to move keeps this very solid."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rat × Tiger— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Different tempo, shared drive",
      "description": "Rat plans carefully; Tiger prefers decisive leaps. Rat can warn Tiger away from obvious pitfalls and help structure plans; Tiger can stop Rat from getting stuck in hesitation or fear. The friction is around control and risk: Rat may quietly judge Tiger as reckless, and Tiger may see Rat as negative or restricting. Clear divisions—some areas where Tiger leads, some where Rat's say is final—help."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rabbit— Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Soft nerves, sharp edges",
      "description": "Rat and Rabbit sit in a punishment (刑) relation where small slights can build into bigger hurt. Rat tends to be more direct and tactical; Rabbit is gentle, sensitive, and conflict-avoidant. At best, Rat protects and organises while Rabbit keeps the tone kind and social ties smooth. At worst, Rabbit swallows hurt instead of speaking, and Rat feels blocked by invisible resistance. Naming issues early and kindly is essential."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dragon— Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Vision plus timing",
      "description": "Rat and Dragon share the San He (三合) \"Visionary\" trine. Dragon brings confidence, presence, and big pushes; Rat contributes timing, negotiation skill, and discipline with resources. Together you're good at turning ambition into measurable progress. Pride and secrecy are the main risks—if Dragon feels second-guessed or Rat feels decisions are made for show, cooperation drops quickly."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rat × Snake— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet strategy",
      "description": "Rat and Snake both prefer to think before they speak and value discretion. Rat monitors the outer situation—money, logistics, deals—while Snake reads motives and long-term patterns. This can be a quietly effective team that rarely gets caught off guard. Problems appear when caution turns into secrecy and tests; it works best when you agree on what must always be honest, no matter what."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rat × Horse — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Freedom versus security",
      "description": "Horse and Rat form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash, highlighting a classic tension between movement and stability. Horse wants open horizons, quick decisions, and freedom to change course; Rat wants security, careful timing, and a solid safety net. At best, Rat keeps Horse from crashing and Horse stops Rat from living in fear. Without clear rules around money and independence, both end up feeling criticised and misunderstood."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Goat — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Soft heart, tight guard",
      "description": "Goat and Rat form a Liu Hai (六害) harm pair, so your anxieties easily rub. Goat worries about belonging, emotional safety, and having enough; Rat worries about money, timing, and being caught unprepared. Rat may see Goat as impractical or too focused on feelings, while Goat may feel watched or judged. Clear budgets, gentle reassurance, and explicit appreciation of each other's efforts keep this from sliding into mutual stress."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rat × Monkey — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Clever synergy",
      "description": "Monkey and Rat are part of the San He (三合) \"Visionary\" trine, making this one of Monkey's sharpest and most mentally alive pairings. Monkey contributes ideas, humour, and agile problem-solving; Rat contributes timing, risk management, and a focus on real-world payoff. Together you spot opportunities early and can turn some into real gains. It goes wrong when you chase too many schemes at once or treat planning as optional."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Order and agility",
      "description": "Rooster values clear rules, structure, and visible order; Rat values flexibility, timing, and practical advantage. At best, Rooster sets standards and plans while Rat finds realistic ways to meet them and adapt on the fly. Rooster may see Rat as evasive or overly opportunistic; Rat may see Rooster as rigid or nit-picky. This pairing works when you agree where strict rules apply and where improvisation is allowed."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dog — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Principle and pragmatism",
      "description": "Dog is loyal, idealistic, and concerned with what feels right; Rat is pragmatic, strategic, and focused on what works. Rat can help Dog turn ideals into practical plans and avoid unnecessary sacrifice, while Dog keeps Rat from crossing ethical lines for convenience. Dog may see Rat as calculating; Rat may see Dog as pessimistic or rigid. This pairing thrives when you agree on a few core values that neither of you will trade away."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rat × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Comfort and caution",
      "description": "Pig is open-hearted, generous, and drawn to enjoyment; Rat is cautious, strategic, and future-focused. Rat can protect Pig from being exploited and help manage money and logistics; Pig can help Rat relax, receive care, and actually enjoy what they've built. Pig may feel over-managed, and Rat may feel they are the only one worrying about risk. Honest, simple planning around savings and treats keeps this feeling safe, not restrictive."
    }
  },
  "ox": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rat— Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Steady builder, sharp planner",
      "description": "Ox and Rat form a Liu He (六合) pair that's practical and quietly powerful. Ox brings stamina, loyalty, and slow, consistent effort; Rat brings good timing, negotiation skills, and an eye for both risk and opportunity. Together you're well suited to building a home, business, or savings over time. It strains if Ox feels rushed or Rat feels their warnings are ignored."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Ox × Ox— Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Shared grind, shared duty",
      "description": "Two Ox together take commitments seriously and usually stick things out through hard times. You can build something solid—a home, business, or family base—through steady effort. The weak points are stubbornness and emotional reserve; neither likes admitting mistakes or vulnerability. Making space for affection and shared fun, not only duty, keeps this from feeling like endless work."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Ox × Tiger— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Slow earth, fast fire",
      "description": "Ox moves slowly and carefully; Tiger leaps and adjusts mid-air. Ox can keep Tiger from burning energy on unrealistic moves; Tiger can keep Ox from getting stuck in a rut. Friction builds if Tiger feels blocked and Ox feels attacked or disrespected. Clear agreements around money, tempo, and big decisions are vital."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rabbit— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet care",
      "description": "Ox offers reliability, patience, and physical steadiness; Rabbit brings tact, charm, and awareness of subtle moods. Together you can build a peaceful, home-centred life if loyalty and simplicity matter to you both. Problems appear when Rabbit feels emotionally overlooked or Ox feels drained by what they see as constant worry."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dragon— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Ground versus glory",
      "description": "Dragon pushes for big outcomes and visibility; Ox wants the basics secure and done properly. Ox can turn Dragon's big ideas into something concrete; Dragon can lift Ox's sights beyond mere survival. It goes wrong if Dragon dismisses Ox as boring or Ox sees Dragon as reckless and self-involved."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Ox × Snake— Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Patient strategists",
      "description": "Ox and Snake share the San He (三合) \"Strategist\" trine. Ox brings endurance, loyalty, and persistence; Snake contributes insight, timing, and careful analysis. This combination suits long-range planning, financial discipline, and slow but meaningful progress. It thrives in privacy, with minimal outside interference."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Ox × Horse — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Routine versus restlessness",
      "description": "Horse and Ox form a Liu Hai (六害) harm pair where your basic rhythms conflict. Ox prefers routine, predictable obligations, and steady progress; Horse needs variety, stimulation, and options. Early on, Ox may feel energised and Horse reassured, but over time Ox can feel exhausted holding everything together while Horse feels trapped. Honest agreements about shared duties and non-negotiable freedoms are essential for this to work."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Goat — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Different needs, shared strain",
      "description": "Goat and Ox sit in a Liu Chong (六冲) clash and also belong to the \"ungrateful-style\" punishment (刑) triangle with Dog, so effort and emotional needs often feel out of sync. Ox shows love through work, duty, and endurance; Goat needs emotional presence, beauty, and reassurance. When it's good, Ox protects and provides while Goat softens life and brings inspiration. When it's bad, both feel unappreciated and tired—naming effort and gratitude out loud is not optional here."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Ox × Monkey — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Improviser meets worker",
      "description": "Monkey likes options, shortcuts, and quick shifts; Ox likes clear duties, steady effort, and predictable routines. Monkey can help Ox adapt to change and find smarter methods, while Ox can help Monkey finish what they start and build something that lasts. Ox may see Monkey as unreliable; Monkey may see Ox as rigid. Agreeing which areas must be stable and which can be experimental keeps frustration down."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rooster — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Work and standards",
      "description": "Rooster and Ox share the San He (三合) \"Strategist\" trine, giving this pairing strong practical potential. Ox brings endurance, loyalty, and willingness to shoulder hard tasks; Rooster brings organisation, accuracy, and a drive to improve systems. Together you can manage work, money, or family duties efficiently and reliably. Just remember to add praise and warmth so it doesn't feel like a permanent audit."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dog — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Duty that feels thankless",
      "description": "Dog and Ox belong to the same \"ungrateful-style\" punishment (刑) triangle with Goat, so both may feel they work hard without full recognition. Ox focuses on carrying tangible responsibilities and doing the heavy lifting; Dog focuses on loyalty, promises, and unseen burdens. Each can end up quietly resentful if they feel their effort is taken for granted. Regularly naming and appreciating what the other does—and adjusting workloads when needed—keeps bitterness from building."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Ox × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Steady hand, soft heart",
      "description": "Ox is patient, hardworking, and willing to carry responsibility; Pig is warm, forgiving, and focused on everyday pleasures. Ox can give Pig stability and a sense of being looked after; Pig can make Ox's life more colourful, affectionate, and less lonely. Tension appears if Pig's spending or indulgence rattles Ox, or Ox's seriousness feels like emotional neglect. This bond flourishes when you agree on what you're building and still leave room for joy."
    }
  },
  "tiger": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rat— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Different tactics, shared courage",
      "description": "Tiger likes to move boldly and visibly; Rat prefers subtle planning and quiet advantage. At your best, Rat can help Tiger avoid obvious traps and manage resources, while Tiger helps Rat take decisive action instead of circling the same worries. The friction comes when Tiger feels second-guessed and Rat feels dragged into risk they did not sign up for. Clear roles—who calls the shots on money, who calls the shots on timing—keep this from turning into a power struggle."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Ox— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Drive meets endurance",
      "description": "Tiger charges toward what feels right in the moment; Ox endures, step by step, regardless of mood. Ox can give Tiger the staying power and structure to see big moves through, while Tiger can stop Ox from wasting years in a situation that has already died. Stress appears when Tiger sees Ox as rigid or joyless, and Ox sees Tiger as disruptive or ungrateful. Agreeing on a few shared priorities, then letting each other handle them in your own style, makes this workable."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Tiger— Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double fire, double will",
      "description": "Two Tigers together create a high-voltage connection full of passion, conviction, and a strong sense of justice. You usually recognise each other's courage and refusal to tolerate hypocrisy, which can feel validating and exciting. The risk is escalation: arguments, life changes, and decisions can all become bigger, faster, and more dramatic than they need to be. This match thrives when you channel your combined fire into shared causes and learn to step down instead of always needing the last, loudest move."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rabbit— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Bold protector, soft observer",
      "description": "Tiger moves directly and confronts problems; Rabbit prefers diplomacy, timing, and quiet adjustments. Tiger can give Rabbit a feeling of protection and permission to say \"no\" more often, while Rabbit helps Tiger avoid unnecessary fights and social damage. If it goes wrong, Rabbit experiences Tiger as loud or insensitive, and Tiger experiences Rabbit as evasive or passive-aggressive. Naming feelings early and respecting Rabbit's need for gentler handling keeps the bond from fraying."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dragon— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two leaders, one story",
      "description": "Tiger and Dragon are both strong-willed and idealistic, with different flavours of authority. Tiger leads from moral instinct and personal courage; Dragon leads from charisma, vision, and a sense of destiny. At best, Tiger keeps Dragon honest and grounded in real ethics, while Dragon helps Tiger think bigger and use influence strategically. Rivalry over who \"owns\" the narrative or gets the spotlight is your biggest hazard, so shared missions and mutual praise matter a lot."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Snake— Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Quiet tests, sharp reactions",
      "description": "Tiger and Snake form a Liu Hai (六害) harm pair and sit together in a classic \"bullying style\" punishment (刑) triangle with Monkey. Tiger is open, impulsive, and bold; Snake is controlled, observant, and slow to reveal their hand. Attraction can be intense, because each brings what the other lacks—raw courage versus deep strategy—but misunderstandings and power tensions come easily. This pairing demands careful listening and clear boundaries around secrets, jealousy, and control if it is going to stay constructive."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Horse — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Running mates",
      "description": "Horse and Tiger share the San He (三合) Adventurer trine, creating one of Horse's most energising matches. Tiger brings courage, conviction, and a willingness to take a stand; Horse brings mobility, social reach, and the ability to keep things moving. You are well suited to big lifestyle changes, travel, or bold career moves when you're aligned. Just make sure someone is watching commitments and practical details so enthusiasm doesn't outpace reality."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Goat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Sensitivity and boldness",
      "description": "Goat is gentle, tactful, and emotionally tuned-in; Tiger is direct, fiery, and driven by instinct. Tiger can advocate for Goat and handle confrontations Goat would rather avoid, while Goat helps Tiger see subtleties and emotional consequences before they leap. Goat may feel scared by Tiger's intensity; Tiger may feel slowed by what they perceive as Goat's worry. This pairing works when courage and kindness are treated as equal values."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Monkey— Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Competitive spark, lesson-heavy",
      "description": "Tiger and Monkey form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash and also sit in the same \"bullying\" punishment (刑) triangle with Snake, so the chemistry is sharp, memorable, and full of tests. Tiger is bold, straightforward, and driven by instinct; Monkey is agile, witty, and driven by clever manoeuvres. You can excite and inspire each other, but you can also trigger pride, one-upmanship, and mind games if trust is low. This pairing works best when you treat each other as sparring partners with rules—clear limits, honest apologies, and no revenge plays."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Critique and courage",
      "description": "Rooster wants things done correctly and isn't shy about saying so; Tiger wants to move decisively and follow their instincts. Rooster can help Tiger avoid obvious errors and plan better; Tiger can help Rooster take bolder actions and not get stuck in over-analysis. If mishandled, Rooster seems nagging and Tiger seems reckless, leading to escalating clashes. Clear agreements about decision-making and when feedback is invited make this more complementary than combative."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dog — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Defenders together",
      "description": "Dog and Tiger share the San He (三合) \"Defender\" trine, uniting courage with conscience. Tiger brings bold moves and readiness to act; Dog brings moral clarity, caution where it matters, and steady support. You're strong in crises and tend to rally around shared causes or people you both care about. Just remember to let life be light sometimes—constant battles, even righteous ones, are exhausting."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Pig — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Soft landing for a warrior",
      "description": "Pig and Tiger form a Liu He (六合) secret-friend pattern, giving Pig a bold yet protective partner. Tiger brings courage, decisiveness, and a willingness to confront what Pig would rather avoid; Pig brings emotional warmth, forgiveness, and a soothing home base. Together you can mix adventure with real emotional safety. The danger is Tiger taking Pig's kindness for granted and Pig staying silent about hurt until it overflows—gentle, honest talks keep this deep and secure."
    }
  },
  "rabbit": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rat— Punishment (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Fast and soft",
      "description": "Rabbit's sensitivity meets Rat's sharp, strategic nature, creating a connection shaped by contrast. Rat brings clarity and structure, while Rabbit adds emotional nuance and softness. As a Xing (刑) \"Punishment\" pairing, unspoken frustrations or differences in style can quietly build if not addressed. The dynamic feels thoughtful and quietly complex, with a blend of calm intuition and quick insight when both stay open and respectful."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Ox— Neutral",
      "tagline": "Gentle and grounded",
      "description": "Rabbit and Ox create a calm, sincere pairing rooted in steadiness and emotional comfort. Ox brings reliability and grounded presence; Rabbit contributes warmth and subtle perception. Together they form a peaceful, understated bond. The connection feels stable, reassuring, and filled with quiet care."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Tiger— Neutral",
      "tagline": "Edge and gentleness",
      "description": "Rabbit's diplomacy balances Tiger's boldness, creating a mix of strength and softness. Tiger offers protection and expressive energy; Rabbit brings calm understanding. Their pace differs, but the relationship forms a gentle equilibrium when attuned. The dynamic feels supportive, tempered, and quietly resilient."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rabbit— Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Soft and cautious",
      "description": "Two Rabbits form a deeply intuitive, emotionally attuned partnership. Sharing the same sensitivity can sometimes lead to withdrawal or over-reflection when feelings get overwhelming, yet the connection is naturally tender and attentive. It feels soothing, empathetic, and quietly harmonious when emotional openness is shared."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dragon— Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Quiet vs. bold",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dragon sit in a Liu Hai (六害) \"Six Harms\" pattern, where caution meets bold ambition in ways that can feel mismatched. Dragon moves with force, confidence, and grand visions, while Rabbit prefers subtlety, emotional safety, and quiet rhythms. Misunderstandings and unmet expectations can build if needs aren't clearly expressed. The dynamic feels dramatic, vivid, and shaped by deep temperament differences."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Snake— Neutral",
      "tagline": "Soft and strategic",
      "description": "Rabbit and Snake share a subtle emotional depth expressed in different ways. Rabbit brings softness and gentle intuition; Snake brings insight, composure, and quiet intensity. Together they create a private, reflective connection. The bond feels calm, perceptive, and quietly layered."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Horse — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Change and comfort",
      "description": "Horse thrives on motion and new experiences; Rabbit wants emotional safety and gentle surroundings. Horse can lift Rabbit out of ruts and bring fresh air into their world, while Rabbit offers Horse a soft place to land and a sense of continuity. Over time, Rabbit may feel worn down by constant change and Horse may feel held back by caution. Agreeing on how often you move, spend, and socialise stops this from turning into a tug-of-war."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Goat — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Kindred spirits",
      "description": "Goat and Rabbit share the San He (三合) \"Artist\" trine, making this one of Goat's most natural and soothing matches. Both care about emotional tone, gentleness, and aesthetic or spiritual comfort, and you usually agree on what feels too harsh. Together you can create a peaceful, beautiful home and a quietly supportive bond. The downside is avoiding hard decisions—talking honestly about money and boundaries keeps this from drifting."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Monkey— Neutral",
      "tagline": "Soft and sharp",
      "description": "Rabbit's calm presence blends with Monkey's lively, inventive energy. Monkey brings spark and movement; Rabbit brings softness and emotional clarity. Together, they create a curious and balanced pairing. The dynamic feels warm, light, and quietly engaging."

      "tagline": "Blunt truth versus soft landing",
      "description": "Rooster and Rabbit form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash with very different views on honesty and tone. Rooster favours direct correction and factual clarity, while Rabbit cares about tact, timing, and emotional safety. Rabbit may feel humiliated or exposed by Rooster's style; Rooster may feel Rabbit is vague, oversensitive, or unwilling to face reality. This match only works if Rooster moderates delivery and Rabbit speaks up about boundaries instead of silently absorbing hurt."

      "tagline": "Trusted confidants",
      "description": "Dog and Rabbit form a Liu He (六合) secret-friend bond that often feels safe and quietly loyal. Rabbit brings tact, sensitivity, and awareness of social nuance; Dog brings honesty, protection, and a strong sense of right and wrong. You usually dislike cruelty and value kindness in similar ways. This pairing deepens when Dog softens their tone and Rabbit speaks more plainly, blending truth with gentleness."

Rabbit brings refinement, social grace, and awareness of subtle moods; Pig brings generosity, sincerity, and enjoyment of life's simple pleasures.

      "tagline": "Ambition with timing",
      "description": "Dragon and Rat share the San He (三合) \"Visionary\" trine, making this one of Dragon's most effective alliances. Dragon brings charisma, bold moves, and a big-picture push; Rat brings timing, negotiation skill, and careful handling of resources. Together you're good at turning big ideas into real wins, especially in career or shared projects. Friction appears when Dragon sees Rat as too cautious or suspicious, and Rat sees Dragon as grandiose or careless with risk. Regular, practical check-ins about money and pacing keep this powerful and sustainable."

    "ox": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Ox— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Drive meets duty",
      "description": "Dragon wants to move toward big outcomes and visible achievements; Ox wants to fulfil responsibilities methodically and without drama. Ox can give Dragon a grounded base, consistent effort, and loyalty when times get hard. Dragon can help Ox aim higher, seize rare chances, and avoid wasting years on something that no longer has life. Problems come when Dragon treats Ox's caution as resistance, or Ox quietly resents Dragon's appetite for change—explicit agreements about direction and pace are crucial."
    },

      "heading": "Dragon × Tiger— Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two alphas, one sky",
      "description": "Dragon and Tiger are both strong-willed, proud, and action-oriented, but their style is different. Tiger follows instinct and moral feeling in the moment; Dragon follows vision and a sense of dramatic timing. At best, Tiger keeps Dragon honest and brave, while Dragon helps Tiger think strategically and play a longer game. Rivalry over leadership, recognition, or whose \"truth\" wins can drain you both. This match works when you consciously choose shared missions and agree to back each other publicly instead of competing."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Rabbit— Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Force and finesse at odds",
      "description": "Dragon and Rabbit form a Liu Hai (六害) harm pair, so your natural styles can bump hard. Dragon prefers decisive, visible action and can be blunt; Rabbit values subtlety, emotional safety, and carefully managed atmospheres. Rabbit may feel steamrolled or exposed by Dragon's big plays; Dragon may feel Rabbit is slowing everything down with worry and \"what will people think.\" This connection only stabilises if Dragon learns to soften delivery and Rabbit speaks up clearly instead of retreating into polite resistance."

      "description": "Two Dragons together amplify charisma, ambition, and the belief that life should be significant. You may feel that you've finally met someone who understands big visions, big feelings, and big risks, which can be intoxicating. But as a self-punishment (自刑) pairing, the same intensity can turn inward—expectations rise, drama escalates, and neither wants to be the one who backs down or admits fault. This match becomes powerful when you share responsibility, use humour to deflate ego clashes, and agree that being kind matters more than being right."

      "description": "Monkey and Snake form a Liu He (六合) secret-friend harmony but also share a punishment (刑) link with Tiger, so this is both supportive and karmic. Snake offers depth, patience, and strategic focus; Monkey offers speed, improvisation, and access to people and information. You can solve complex problems together and navigate social or work situations better than most pairs. If trust slips, it easily turns into tests, half-truths, and mental fencing, so honesty must be a core rule."

      "description": "Monkey thinks fast; Horse moves fast. This pairing is good for spontaneity, travel, and trying new things, with Monkey handling improvisation and Horse providing raw momentum. The weak spot is consistency—plans shift quickly and boring tasks get neglected. A few shared non-negotiables around money, health, or family keep the chaos fun instead of destructive."

Monkey can open Goat's world and help navigate difficult conversations; Goat can give Monkey a stable, accepting base and refine their taste and environment. Goat may feel rattled by constant change or sharp humour; Monkey may feel smothered by emotional demands. This works when Monkey stays kind with words and Goat says clearly what feels safe or not."

The risk is scattered focus, drama for entertainment, and avoiding serious commitments until problems pile up. This match shines when you set a few clear priorities and treat them as sacred, not just another option."

Rooster can help Monkey refine plans and avoid obvious mistakes, while Monkey keeps Rooster from getting stuck in criticism and over-caution. Both are sharp, so clashes of pride and tone are likely if feedback isn't handled carefully. Setting explicit rules about how you argue and what counts as \"constructive\" keeps respect intact."

Monkey can help Dog find creative, less painful solutions and lighten heavy moods; Dog can help Monkey understand where the real lines are and why trust matters. Dog may see Monkey as slippery, Monkey may see Dog as joy-killing. Agreeing on a few absolute boundaries and giving Monkey freedom inside them keeps this dynamic interesting instead of explosive."

Monkey's teasing, changing plans, or casual words can cut more deeply than they intend, while Pig's emotional needs or spending can feel heavy to Monkey.

At best, Rooster sets standards and plans while Rat finds realistic ways to meet them and adapt on the fly.

Rooster can help Tiger avoid obvious errors and plan better; Tiger can help Rooster take bolder actions and not get stuck in over-analysis.
