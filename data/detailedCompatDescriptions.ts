  "rat": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rat — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Sharp minds, busy lives",
      "description": "Two Rats together think fast and notice small shifts in money, mood, and opportunity. You can be a strong survival team who adapts quickly when life changes. The tension comes from worry, subtle competition, and the temptation to over-plan everything. This works best when you share clear goals and treat each other as partners, not rivals."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rat × Ox — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Quiet backbone",
      "description": "Rat and Ox form a Liu He \"secret friend\" pattern, one of the steadiest bonds in the cycle. Ox brings endurance, patience, and a willingness to do the slow, heavy work; Rat brings strategy, timing, and clever problem-solving. The chemistry isn't always loud, but there's usually a feeling that you can rely on each other when it counts. This pairing thrives when Rat respects Ox's pace and Ox trusts Rat's instinct about when it's time to pivot."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rat × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Planner meets pacesetter",
      "description": "Rat likes to think ahead and hedge against risk; Tiger likes to jump in and adjust on the move. Rat can help Tiger avoid obvious pitfalls and manage resources; Tiger can help Rat stop circling the same worries and actually act. If you're not careful, Tiger feels blocked and Rat feels dragged into chaos. Clear agreements about money and timing keep this from turning into a tug-of-war."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rabbit — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Soft tone, sharp edges",
      "description": "Rat and Rabbit form a punishment (刑) pattern, so small slips in manners or tone can hit harder than expected. Rat tends to be more direct and tactical; Rabbit is gentler and avoids open conflict. When it's working, Rat protects Rabbit's interests and Rabbit keeps things socially smooth. It turns sour when Rabbit swallows hurt instead of speaking and Rat thinks \"if it's important, they'll say it,\" so early, honest conversations matter."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dragon — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Visionary Trine)",
      "tagline": "Vision and timing",
      "description": "Rat and Dragon share the San He \"Visionary\" trine, making it easy to dream big and move on opportunities together. Dragon brings presence, confidence, and a push toward larger goals; Rat brings realism, negotiation skill, and a sense of when the moment is right. You're good at turning ideas into tangible advances. The pairing is strongest when Dragon listens to Rat on risk and Rat doesn't undercut Dragon's confidence."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rat × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet strategy",
      "description": "Rat and Snake both prefer to observe, think, and then act, rather than rushing in. Snake reads motives and long-term patterns; Rat tracks information, resources, and timing on the ground. Together you can avoid a lot of obvious mistakes that catch other people. The danger is too much secrecy and testing, so you need a few areas where full honesty is the rule."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rat × Horse — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Security versus freedom",
      "description": "Rat and Horse form a Liu Chong clash, so your default priorities collide. Rat wants stability, savings, and a feeling that the basics are under control; Horse wants freedom, space, and the ability to change plans quickly. Early on, Rat may admire Horse's courage and Horse may enjoy Rat's cleverness. Over time, if you don't set clear rules about money and independence, you both feel judged and misunderstood."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Goat — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Different worries, same knot",
      "description": "Rat and Goat form a Liu Hai harm pair, so anxiety can easily build between you. Rat worries about future risk and being caught unprepared; Goat worries about being unsupported, unloved, or left alone with problems. Rat may see Goat as impractical or overly emotional, while Goat may experience Rat as cold or critical. Simple routines around money and lots of reassurance on both sides help keep this gentle instead of draining."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rat × Monkey — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Visionary Trine)",
      "tagline": "High-speed collaboration",
      "description": "Rat and Monkey complete the San He Visionary trine, so this pairing feels quick, bright, and mentally alive. Monkey brings creativity, humour, and agile problem-solving; Rat brings structure, follow-through, and an instinct for what will actually work. Together you're good at spotting opportunities early and making something out of them. You just need to finish a few things instead of living in permanent \"new idea\" mode."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rooster — Neutral (中) · Break Pattern (Po 破)",
      "tagline": "Standards and shortcuts",
      "description": "Rat and Rooster are broadly Neutral but linked by a Po break pattern, so long stable periods can be punctured by sharp disagreements. Rooster likes clear rules, open critique, and visible order; Rat prefers flexible plans and quiet fixes. You can be effective when Rooster sets standards and Rat finds practical ways to meet them. The \"break\" tendency shows when feedback turns into nagging or Rat's manoeuvres are seen as dishonest, so tone and transparency are key."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dog — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Ethics meets survival",
      "description": "Dog worries about fairness, loyalty, and doing right by people; Rat worries about survival, advantage, and not wasting chances. Dog can stop Rat from crossing lines that would damage trust long-term; Rat can help Dog find realistic solutions instead of just feeling responsible for everything. Friction shows up when Dog sees Rat as calculating and Rat sees Dog as negative or naïve. Shared rules about money, promises, and what you owe others keep this grounded."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rat × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Care and caution",
      "description": "Pig brings warmth, generosity, and a love of comfort; Rat brings foresight, resource management, and a cautious eye. Pig helps Rat relax and enjoy what they have; Rat helps Pig avoid being taken advantage of or sliding into debt or chaos. Over time, Rat can feel cast as the permanent \"bad cop,\" and Pig can feel monitored instead of loved. Talking clearly about budgets and treats keeps the balance kind and fair."
    }
  },
  "ox": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rat — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Builder and strategist",
      "description": "Ox and Rat form a Liu He secret-friend pairing that's practical and productive. Ox brings stamina, loyalty, and a willingness to do what's necessary even when it's boring; Rat brings ideas, timing, and an instinct for risk. You're good at slowly improving your shared situation. This thrives when Rat respects Ox's pace and Ox listens when Rat says, \"This move is too risky.\""
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Ox × Ox — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Shared grind",
      "description": "Two Ox together can carry a lot—work, family responsibilities, simple but important tasks. You're both stubborn, and once committed, you tend to endure rather than bail out. That makes you reliable, but it can also trap you in situations that no longer work. Scheduling joy and reviewing whether old commitments still make sense keeps this from becoming a life of nothing but duty."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Ox × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Slow earth, fast flame",
      "description": "Ox moves carefully and steadily; Tiger moves quickly and trusts their instincts. Ox can help Tiger see the long-term cost of impulsive choices; Tiger can help Ox break out of ruts and leave dead situations. If neither side bends, Ox experiences Tiger as disruptive and Tiger sees Ox as suffocating. Agreements about which decisions can be spontaneous and which must be discussed are essential."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rabbit — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet care",
      "description": "Ox offers reliability, patience, and practical support; Rabbit offers tact, social grace, and emotional awareness. Together you can build a peaceful, home-centred life if both value loyalty and calm. Problems arise when Rabbit feels emotionally overlooked or Ox feels worn down by what they see as endless worry or sensitivity. A mix of predictable routines and small, thoughtful gestures keeps this steady."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dragon — Neutral (中) · Break Pattern (Po 破)",
      "tagline": "Duty and drama",
      "description": "Ox and Dragon are Neutral with a Po break pattern underneath, so stretches of cooperation can end in sharp turning points. Ox focuses on practical tasks and keeping things running; Dragon focuses on big pushes, impact, and being seen. You can achieve a lot when Ox maintains the base and Dragon handles expansion. The break energy shows up when Ox feels unrecognised or Dragon feels blocked, so honest talks about pace and credit matter."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Ox × Snake — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Strategist Trine)",
      "tagline": "Slow-burning strategy",
      "description": "Ox and Snake share the San He \"Strategist\" trine, so you're both comfortable with patience and thinking ahead. Ox contributes endurance and a dependable presence; Snake contributes timing, insight, and a sense of where energy is best spent. You're suited to long-term projects and quiet progress. Protecting the relationship from gossip and outside noise keeps this unusually stable."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Ox × Horse — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Routine versus restlessness",
      "description": "Ox and Horse form a Liu Hai harm pairing, so your natural rhythms can grind. Ox wants predictable obligations and clear structure; Horse wants mobility, stimulation, and the ability to change plans. Early on, Ox may find Horse exciting and Horse may enjoy Ox's grounding. Over time, if responsibilities aren't shared fairly, Ox feels used and Horse feels trapped."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Goat — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) with a punishment overlay",
      "tagline": "Effort and appreciation",
      "description": "Ox and Goat form a clash pair and also sit in a punishment-style triangle with Dog, so effort and gratitude are touchy topics. Ox often shows love by working, providing, and enduring; Goat shows love by caring, soothing, and keeping emotional space soft. When the patterns run unconsciously, both can feel overworked and under-appreciated, even while they're trying hard. This pairing settles into something strong when you name what each person is actually doing, say thank you more than you think you need to, and redistribute tasks before resentment hardens."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Ox × Monkey — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Structure and improvisation",
      "description": "Ox prefers plans and predictable effort; Monkey prefers options, clever shortcuts, and quick changes. Monkey can help Ox adapt and find smarter ways to do things; Ox can help Monkey stick with projects long enough to see real results. Without balance, Ox finds Monkey chaotic and Monkey finds Ox boring or controlling. You need a few fixed rules and a few \"play zones\" where change is allowed."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rooster — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Strategist Trine)",
      "tagline": "Work and standards",
      "description": "Ox and Rooster share the Strategist trine, so both care about doing things properly and sticking with commitments. Rooster brings organisation, detail, and a willingness to call out problems; Ox brings hard work, loyalty, and physical staying power. You can run homes, projects, or businesses efficiently together. To keep warmth alive, remember that not every moment needs improvement; some are just for enjoying what you've built."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dog — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Duty that needs softness",
      "description": "Dog and Ox share a punishment-style pattern that tends to load both people up with responsibility. Ox shoulders practical burdens and keeps things running; Dog shoulders worry, vigilance, and a sense of moral duty. The connection can be incredibly solid when you both feel seen for what you carry, but heavy when the only language between you is \"who has sacrificed more.\" You do best when you bring in softness on purpose—praise, humour, small pleasures—so the bond isn't built solely on endurance."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Ox × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Provider and comfort-maker",
      "description": "Ox brings reliability and willingness to work; Pig brings warmth, generosity, and a talent for making life feel pleasant. Pig helps Ox enjoy the fruits of their labour and soften their edges; Ox gives Pig a stable foundation and protection. Trouble starts when Pig's indulgence rattles Ox's sense of security or Ox's seriousness feels like a permanent \"no.\" Simple agreements about money and downtime keep this kind and easy."
    }
  },
  "tiger": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Different tactics, similar courage",
      "description": "Tiger acts on instinct and principle; Rat acts on timing and strategy. Rat can help Tiger avoid obvious traps and manage resources; Tiger can help Rat stop overthinking and take a clear stand. Each may feel the other is blocking their natural style. This stays workable when you divide decisions into areas where courage leads and areas where calculation leads."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Drive meets endurance",
      "description": "Tiger is fiery and fast; Ox is steady and slow. Ox can anchor Tiger's big pushes so they don't fizzle; Tiger can stop Ox wasting years in situations that are clearly done. If respect is missing, Ox sees Tiger as disruptive and Tiger sees Ox as joyless. Shared priorities and a clear sense of \"why\" help you pull in the same direction."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Tiger — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double fire",
      "description": "Two Tigers together create a strong, intense connection with plenty of passion and conflict. You recognise each other's bravery and sense of justice, which can feel very validating. The downside is escalation: arguments, decisions, and even good surprises can all get bigger than necessary. Learning to step back first instead of last is what makes this sustainable."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rabbit — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Bold and gentle",
      "description": "Tiger moves directly; Rabbit moves carefully and prefers diplomacy. Tiger can protect Rabbit and push for changes Rabbit secretly wants; Rabbit can help Tiger avoid unnecessary fights and social fallout. If you aren't mindful, Rabbit feels bulldozed and Tiger feels they're walking on eggshells. Honest conversations about how you argue and how you apologise keep trust intact."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dragon — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two leaders, different styles",
      "description": "Tiger leads from instinct and a sense of right and wrong; Dragon leads from vision and a sense of destiny or image. You can champion each other's causes and create visible impact. Without humility, this turns into a battle over who gets the final say or the glory. Shared missions and explicit mutual support keep you from sliding into rivalry."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Snake — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑) · Bullying triangle edge",
      "tagline": "Quiet tension, strong lessons",
      "description": "Tiger and Snake sit in a punishment-type pattern that can create a background hum of tension even when nothing dramatic is happening. Tiger wants to act cleanly and openly; Snake wants to watch, time, and act with subtlety, and each can feel the other is undermining their natural way of moving. In the best version, you learn when to go straight through a problem and when to use finesse, and end up respecting each other's very different strengths. If you ignore the tension, it tends to show up as sharp, memorable conflicts, so honest, early conversations help more here than in most pairings."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Horse — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Adventurer Trine)",
      "tagline": "Running partners",
      "description": "Tiger and Horse share the San He Adventurer trine, so life together rarely feels dull. Horse brings movement, social reach, and a willingness to just go; Tiger brings conviction, bravery, and the readiness to confront problems. You're well suited to big changes—moves, new careers, fresh projects. A bit of structure around money, rest, and long-term plans turns this from chaos into a shared adventure."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Goat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Protector and sensitive soul",
      "description": "Tiger often steps into a protector role; Goat is attuned to feelings, atmosphere, and beauty. Tiger can shield Goat from harsher people and situations; Goat can soften Tiger's edges and remind them of emotional consequences. Problems arise when Tiger dismisses Goat's sensitivities or Goat quietly resents Tiger's bluntness. Consistent reassurance and small, concrete acts of care keep this gentle and strong."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Monkey — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) with a pressure overlay",
      "tagline": "Competitive spark",
      "description": "Tiger and Monkey form a classic clash pair, so the differences in style and instinct stay vivid. Tiger moves boldly and directly, with a strong sense of what feels right; Monkey moves through wit, experiments, and clever manoeuvres. There's also a traditional \"pressure\" overlay here that can push small disagreements into real tests of respect and trust if you're not paying attention. When you deliberately channel the clash into shared challenges rather than one-upmanship, the connection feels exciting and growth-heavy instead of exhausting."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Action and critique",
      "description": "Tiger wants to move and deal with things; Rooster wants to analyse, organise, and correct. Rooster can help Tiger plan better and avoid obvious mistakes; Tiger can help Rooster stop procrastinating and actually act. If you're careless, Rooster comes off as nagging and Tiger as reckless. Setting rules about when feedback is welcome keeps this from turning sour."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dog — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Defender Trine)",
      "tagline": "Standing guard together",
      "description": "Tiger and Dog share the San He Defender trine, so both care deeply about loyalty and fairness. Dog brings conscience, steadiness, and long-term commitment; Tiger brings courage, initiative, and the willingness to take risks for what matters. You tend to have each other's backs under pressure. The main risk is burnout from constant battles, so make space for simple joy and rest."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Pig — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合) with a turning-point edge",
      "tagline": "Protector and healer",
      "description": "Tiger and Pig share a Liu He secret-friend bond that often feels protective and unexpectedly tender. Tiger brings courage, decisions, and a willingness to confront what Pig might rather avoid; Pig brings warmth, forgiveness, and emotional nourishment. There is also a sharper \"turning-point\" edge in this pairing in some charts, meaning big conflicts can trigger decisive changes rather than long, slow fades. When you talk openly about limits and deal-breakers, this becomes a bond where both protection and comfort can grow over time."
    }
  },
  "rabbit": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rat — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Soft shell, sharp friction",
      "description": "Rabbit and Rat sit in a punishment (刑) pattern, so minor slips in tone, manners, or timing can land harder than expected. Rat tends to be more blunt and tactical; Rabbit is softer, more indirect, and conflict-avoidant. At your best, Rat protects Rabbit's interests and Rabbit keeps social and emotional waters calm. To stop this from turning into quiet resentment, Rabbit needs to say what hurts and Rat needs to treat tact as a real need, not a luxury."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Gentle heart, steady hand",
      "description": "Rabbit is tuned to feelings and atmosphere; Ox is tuned to tasks, duty, and slow progress. Ox can give Rabbit a sense of physical and financial safety, while Rabbit brings warmth and social ease into Ox's life. The pairing often works well if both value a calmer, home-centred rhythm. Problems show up when Rabbit feels emotionally overlooked and Ox feels drained by what they see as too much worry."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet strategy and bold moves",
      "description": "Rabbit prefers timing and subtle influence; Tiger prefers direct action and visible stands. Tiger can make Rabbit feel protected and more willing to say \"no\" when needed, while Rabbit can help Tiger avoid unnecessary conflicts and social damage. The tension is that Rabbit may find Tiger too loud or rough, and Tiger may see Rabbit as evasive. You do best when you treat each other's instincts—softening versus confronting—as complementary rather than wrong."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rabbit — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double sensitivity",
      "description": "Two Rabbits together create a gentle, refined, and emotionally aware connection. You often sense each other's moods without many words and care deeply about avoiding harshness. The risk is that hurt feelings get swallowed instead of discussed, and politeness replaces honesty. This becomes a strong match when you treat honest conversations as part of kindness, not a threat to peace."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dragon — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Finesse versus force",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dragon form a Liu Hai harm pair, so your styles can step on each other's toes. Dragon pushes boldly and likes decisive, sometimes dramatic moves; Rabbit wants safety, gradual change, and a calm environment. Done well, Dragon opens doors and Rabbit helps manage impact and tone. If Dragon keeps overruling Rabbit's concerns or Rabbit never clearly says \"this is too much,\" the bond gets brittle."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Soft intuition, quiet depth",
      "description": "Rabbit is gentle and responsive; Snake is reserved, analytical, and slow to trust. Snake brings depth, pattern-spotting, and a careful sense of timing; Rabbit brings social skill, warmth, and an eye for comfort. There's potential for a very subtle, empathetic link here. It frays when Rabbit reads Snake's quiet as rejection and Snake reads Rabbit's diplomacy as insincerity, so verbal reassurance matters."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Horse — Neutral (中) · Break Pattern (Po 破)",
      "tagline": "Comfort meets motion with jolts",
      "description": "Rabbit and Horse are essentially Neutral but tied by a Po (破) break pattern, so your different rhythms can lead to sudden shifts in the relationship. Rabbit seeks emotional safety, familiar comforts, and a manageable pace; Horse seeks movement, novelty, and open options. Horse can expand Rabbit's world and prevent stagnation, while Rabbit offers Horse a soft landing and continuity. The break energy appears when changes pile up faster than Rabbit can process, or when Horse feels guilt-tripped for needing freedom, so honest planning around travel, spending, and downtime is crucial."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Goat — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Kindred spirits",
      "description": "Goat and Rabbit share the San He (三合) \"Artist\" trine, making this one of Goat's most natural and soothing matches. Both care about emotional tone, gentleness, and aesthetic or spiritual comfort, and you usually agree on what feels too harsh. Together you can create a peaceful, beautiful home and a quietly supportive bond. The downside is avoiding hard decisions—talking honestly about money and boundaries keeps this from drifting."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Monkey— Neutral",
      "tagline": "Soft and sharp",
      "description": "Rabbit's calm presence blends with Monkey's lively, inventive energy. Monkey brings spark and movement; Rabbit brings softness and emotional clarity. Together, they create a curious and balanced pairing. The dynamic feels warm, light, and quietly engaging."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rooster — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Blunt truth versus soft landing",
      "description": "Rooster and Rabbit form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash with very different views on honesty and tone. Rooster favours direct correction and factual clarity, while Rabbit cares about tact, timing, and emotional safety. Rabbit may feel humiliated or exposed by Rooster's style; Rooster may feel Rabbit is vague, oversensitive, or unwilling to face reality. This match only works if Rooster moderates delivery and Rabbit speaks up about boundaries instead of silently absorbing hurt."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dog — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Trusted companions",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dog form a Liu He secret-friend pattern that often feels like \"we're on the same side.\" Rabbit brings tact, social sensitivity, and an instinct for creating a gentle atmosphere; Dog brings loyalty, moral backbone, and the courage to stand up when something isn't right. You're usually aligned on basic decency and what feels safe or unsafe in relationships. This match deepens when Dog softens their tone a little, and Rabbit swaps hints for clear words when something is wrong."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Pig — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Gentle alliance",
      "description": "Pig and Rabbit share the San He (三合) \"Artist\" trine, creating a soft, affectionate, and often very cosy bond. Rabbit brings refinement, social grace, and awareness of subtle moods; Pig brings generosity, sincerity, and enjoyment of life's simple pleasures. You are usually aligned on kindness and dislike of harshness. Light structure around money, health, and obligations prevents this from drifting into sweet but stressful chaos."

  "dragon": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Rat — Same Trine (San He 三合 · Visionary Trine)",
      "tagline": "Big plans, sharp timing",
      "description": "Dragon and Rat share the Visionary trine, making it natural to aim high together. Dragon brings charisma, daring, and a sense of scale; Rat brings realism, timing, and resource management. You're good at spotting opportunities and turning some of them into real gains. It works best when Dragon doesn't treat caution as negativity and Rat doesn't quietly resent Dragon's appetite for risk."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Ox — Neutral (中) · Break Pattern (Po 破)",
      "tagline": "Drive and duty with turning points",
      "description": "Dragon and Ox are basically Neutral but carry a Po break pattern, so long stretches of cooperation can end in sharp shifts. Ox handles the grind, the bills, and the unglamorous tasks; Dragon aims for bigger impact and more visible moves. You can build something serious when those roles are respected. The break energy appears when Ox feels used or Dragon feels blocked, so regular reality checks about direction and workload are vital."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two alphas, one story",
      "description": "Dragon and Tiger are both strong-willed and action-oriented, but their motivation differs. Tiger follows instinct and justice in the moment; Dragon follows vision and legacy. You can back each other in crises and push each other to be braver. Without humility, this turns into rivalry, so shared missions and genuine praise matter more than you might think."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Rabbit — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Force and finesse at odds",
      "description": "Dragon and Rabbit form a Liu Hai harm pair, so your ways of handling life can rub. Dragon is direct, sometimes dramatic, and focused on pushing forward; Rabbit is cautious, subtle, and focused on emotional safety.

      "description": "Two Monkeys together create a fast-paced, idea-heavy relationship. You probably never run out of things to talk about or try. The danger is scattering your energy, turning everything into a game, and dodging big commitments until problems pile up. This match matures when you choose a few shared goals and treat them as seriously as you treat your fun."

Pride clashes appear when Rooster's corrections feel like insults and Monkey's jokes feel like mockery. Keeping criticism task-focused and remembering to praise what works stops this turning sour."

Dog can keep Monkey from crossing lines that damage trust, while Monkey helps Dog see creative, less painful options. Dog may worry that Monkey is slippery; Monkey may feel judged or policed. Clear boundaries about what's non-negotiable—and genuine freedom inside those lines—let you bring out the best in each other."

Pig leads with openness, generosity, and emotional availability; Monkey leads with speed, humour, and a more playful relationship to promises and plans. When you're tuned in, Monkey helps Pig laugh and adapt, and Pig helps Monkey feel loved rather than constantly \"on.\" When you're not, teasing cuts too deep and feelings get heavy fast, so having clear agreements about jokes, money, and apologies goes a long way."

      "description": "Rooster and Rat are essentially Neutral but linked by a Po break pattern, so small issues can suddenly become big fractures. Rooster wants things explicit, organised, and \"done right\"; Rat wants flexibility, quiet fixes, and realistic compromises. When you sync, Rooster sets standards and Rat finds clever ways to meet them. When you don't, Rooster feels undermined and Rat feels micromanaged, so regular, honest debriefs keep the break factor low."

Ox brings staying power and reliability; Rooster brings structure, quality control, and the willingness to speak up when something's off.

Rooster favours direct correction and clear standards; Rabbit favours tact and emotional cushioning. Rabbit can feel exposed or humiliated if Rooster doesn't manage tone, and Rooster can feel blocked if Rabbit avoids difficult topics. This only works if you separate private feedback from public front and both agree on basic kindness in delivery."

Dragon brings presence, vision, and a push toward big moves; Rooster brings organisation, realism, and the willingness to handle messy details. Together you can make ambitious plans actually work in practice, not just in theory. The key is credit: this pairing feels best when Dragon publicly honours Rooster's behind-the-scenes work, and Rooster respects Dragon's role at the front."

Rooster can help Horse stabilise their life so risks are better contained; Horse can help Rooster live a little and not over-identify with problems.

As a self-punishment pairing, though, the critical gaze easily turns inward, and everyday life can start to feel like a never-ending audit. Intentionally lowering the bar in some areas and praising what's good keeps this sharp bond humane."

Ox shoulders practical burdens and keeps things running; Dog shoulders worry, vigilance, and a sense of moral duty. The connection can be incredibly solid when you both feel seen for what you carry, but heavy when the only language between you is \"who has sacrificed more.\" You do best when you bring in softness on purpose—praise, humour, small pleasures—so the bond isn't built solely on endurance."

You're usually aligned on basic decency and what feels safe or unsafe in relationships. This match deepens when Dog softens their tone a little, and Rabbit swaps hints for clear words when something is wrong."

Dragon wants impact, recognition, and big moves; Dog wants to be able to look themselves in the mirror and feel they've been fair. When aligned, you can accomplish meaningful things without selling your soul. When misaligned, it becomes a long tug-of-war over lines and compromises, so shared principles are crucial."

Snake can help Dog see shades of grey and hidden motives; Dog can help Snake act instead of watching from the sidelines. Each can be suspicious of the other—Dog of perceived evasiveness, Snake of perceived rigidity. A shared framework for judging situations keeps this from turning into mutual judgement."

Goat worries about emotional safety and atmosphere; Dog worries about danger, betrayal, and whether everyone is doing the right thing. You care deeply, but if you never feel properly appreciated, small hurts can suddenly snap into bigger ruptures. Planning actual relief for both of you—and saying out loud what you value in each other—softens both the pressure and the break tendencies."

Dog can shield Pig from harsh people and situations, while Pig can soothe Dog's nerves and offer real emotional care. Issues show up around spending, boundaries, and how much you take on for others. Clear agreements and occasional \"no, we can't help this one\" decisions protect both of you."

Rat can help Pig avoid being taken advantage of and keep finances or logistics under control; Pig can help Rat relax, trust a bit more, and actually enjoy what they've built.

      "description": "Ox brings patience, hard work, and a sense of duty; Pig brings warmth, forgiveness, and enjoyment of everyday pleasures. Ox can give Pig a stable foundation and protection; Pig can make Ox's life less lonely and more colourful. Friction appears when Pig's indulgence rattles Ox's sense of security or Ox's seriousness feels like emotional distance. Regular talks about priorities and spending keep it balanced."

      "description": "Pig and Tiger form a Liu He secret-friend bond, giving Pig a bold but fundamentally protective partner; your branches also share a Po break pattern, so certain conflicts can trigger sharp shifts. Tiger brings courage, decisions, and a willingness to confront what Pig avoids; Pig brings acceptance, comfort, and emotional healing. In a good phase, life feels both exciting and safe. When Pig's limits are ignored or Tiger feels unappreciated, the break energy shows as sudden ultimatums, so you're better off naming issues early."

Dragon can help Pig believe they deserve more and push for it; Pig can keep Dragon grounded and remind them to rest and receive care. The risk is Pig becoming background emotional labour if Dragon never looks down from the big picture. Clear sharing of responsibilities and explicit appreciation keeps this nourishing."

The friction comes when neither wants to slow down, back down, or apologise first. Taking turns leading—and treating compromise as teamwork, not defeat—keeps this from burning out."

Taurus can help Aries finish what they start and turn raw impulses into something tangible. Aries can help Taurus avoid getting stuck in routine or fear of change and bring more courage into the picture. You need real conversations about pace, money, and how often life can be shaken up so neither feels dragged nor dragged down."

      "tagline": "Spark and ideas",
      "description": "Aries brings drive, initiative, and a willingness to act; Gemini brings curiosity, humour, and mental agility. Together you're good at trying new things, keeping conversation flowing, and avoiding stagnation. There's usually a sense of motion and a lot of small adventures, even in everyday life. To keep it from feeling scattered or shallow, you both need to commit to finishing some projects and having the occasional serious talk without hiding behind jokes or distractions."

      "heading": "Aries × Cancer — Challenging Elements (Fire + Water)",
      "tagline": "Drive and protectiveness",
      "description": "Aries leads with blunt action; Cancer leads with emotional safety and intuition. Cancer can feel rushed, criticised, or exposed by Aries' speed and tone, while Aries may feel confused by Cancer's indirect moods or sudden retreat. At your best, Aries gives Cancer courage to step forward and Cancer gives Aries a deeper sense of belonging and loyalty. This match survives on explicit respect for feelings and on learning how to argue without making the other person feel unsafe at their core."

Leo brings warmth, loyalty, and a strong sense of presence; Aries brings raw drive and the willingness to take the first risk. You can easily become each other's loudest supporter and create a relationship full of stories and shared victories. The main hazard is pride—if neither can admit fault, small conflicts become unnecessary dramas."

      "description": "Aries wants to move and adjust on the fly; Virgo wants working systems and fewer preventable mistakes. Virgo can help Aries refine ideas, catch obvious issues, and make efforts more efficient. Aries can help Virgo stop endlessly editing life and actually pull the trigger on needed changes. It works when criticism stays practical and kind, and when Aries doesn't interpret every suggestion as an insult."

      "description": "Aries and Libra stand at opposite ends of the same line: raw desire versus considered dialogue, \"I want\" versus \"we decide.\" In astrology, this opposition is often treated as a long-term growth axis rather than a guaranteed fairy tale—each holds qualities the other needs to balance out. Aries brings courage, heat, and a willingness to move when things are stuck; Libra brings perspective, grace, and an instinct for how choices land on other people. When you work with that tension instead of against it, it feels like learning to be both honest and kind; when you don't, it slips into a tug-of-war between bluntness and avoidance."

The attraction can be strong because neither of you feels faint-hearted, but so can power struggles if one feels the other is hiding or bulldozing. Scorpio pushes for emotional truth and lasting transformation, while Aries pushes for immediate action and clear answers. You need shared goals and a strict no-games rule if you want the intensity without constant tests."

Sagittarius adds humour, philosophy, and a wider perspective to Aries' straightforward drive. You're likely to encourage each other to travel, experiment, or take risks others might shy away from. The downside is that day-to-day structure and responsibilities can get neglected unless one of you consciously takes them seriously."

Capricorn can give Aries a framework so all that energy actually builds toward something durable. Aries can help Capricorn avoid becoming so duty-bound or cautious that life shrinks into nothing but obligation. The tension sits around authority and respect, so you need clear agreements about who decides what and a shared sense that both speed and strategy have value."

      "tagline": "Rebels in motion",
      "description": "Aries brings physical or practical action; Aquarius brings big-picture ideas, ideals, and a taste for the unconventional. Together you're inclined to break stale routines, challenge assumptions, or throw yourselves into something different from the norm. There is often a strong friendship or comrade-in-arms feeling alongside attraction. To keep it from becoming a purely mental or activist connection, you both have to show up emotionally and not treat feelings as background noise."

Pisces may feel overwhelmed or misunderstood by Aries' pace and bluntness, while Aries may feel lost in Pisces' shifting inner world. At your best, Aries helps Pisces give shape to dreams and take practical steps, and Pisces helps Aries soften, listen, and notice the emotional field around their actions. Patience, reassurance, and clear boundaries are essential if you want the contrast to feel supportive instead of exhausting."

      "description": "Two Capricorns can build a serious, ambitious, quietly resilient partnership. You often respect each other's work ethic, reliability, and long-term plans, and may feel relieved to be understood on pressure and duty. The risk is letting life become all goals and responsibilities with little room for softness. Protecting time for rest, affection, and small joys keeps this from feeling like a job."

Aquarius can help Capricorn see where rules can be bent or systems can be improved; Capricorn can help Aquarius ground their ideals and navigate power realistically. You might clash when Aquarius wants change for principle's sake and Capricorn sees only risk, or when Capricorn clings to hierarchy that Aquarius finds meaningless. A shared sense of purpose about what you're building or changing together holds it steady."

Pisces can soften Capricorn's edges and remind them that not everything can be measured; Capricorn can keep Pisces anchored when life feels overwhelming or vague. You can build something quietly strong and meaningful when both roles are respected. Be careful not to slip into a parent–child dynamic where one always holds it together and the other always drifts."

You value independence, ideas, and doing life in your own way rather than following the script. That sameness can be liberating, especially if you've both felt \"different\" elsewhere, but it also makes it easy to postpone deeper emotional sharing. Practising vulnerability on purpose stops this from drifting into polite distance."
