  "rat": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rat — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Quick minds, shared nerves",
      "description": "Two Rats together create a sharp, alert partnership that notices changes in money, mood, and opportunity fast. You're both good at adapting, saving when needed, and spotting chances early. The stress comes from worry and subtle competition over who decides, who controls resources, or who plans better. This stays strong when you agree clearly on goals and treat each other as allies, not rivals."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rat × Ox — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Quietly strong team",
      "description": "Rat and Ox form a Liu He (六合) bond known for reliability and long-term building. Ox brings patience, staying power, and a willingness to shoulder heavy work; Rat brings timing, ideas, and a keen eye for risk and advantage. Together you're well suited to paying off debts, growing savings, or slowly improving your base. Respecting Ox's slower pace and trusting Rat's instincts about when to move keeps this very solid."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rat × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Different tempo, shared drive",
      "description": "Rat plans carefully; Tiger prefers decisive leaps. Rat can warn Tiger away from obvious pitfalls and help structure plans; Tiger can stop Rat from getting stuck in hesitation or fear. The friction is around control and risk: Rat may quietly judge Tiger as reckless, and Tiger may see Rat as negative or restricting. Clear divisions—some areas where Tiger leads, some where Rat's say is final—help."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rabbit — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Soft nerves, sharp edges",
      "description": "Rat and Rabbit sit in a punishment (刑) relation where small slights can build into bigger hurt. Rat tends to be more direct and tactical; Rabbit is gentle, sensitive, and conflict-avoidant. At best, Rat protects and organises while Rabbit keeps the tone kind and social ties smooth. At worst, Rabbit swallows hurt instead of speaking, and Rat feels blocked by invisible resistance. Naming issues early and kindly is essential."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dragon — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Vision plus timing",
      "description": "Rat and Dragon share the San He (三合) \"Visionary\" trine. Dragon brings confidence, presence, and big pushes; Rat contributes timing, negotiation skill, and discipline with resources. Together you're good at turning ambition into measurable progress. Pride and secrecy are the main risks—if Dragon feels second-guessed or Rat feels decisions are made for show, cooperation drops quickly."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rat × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet strategy",
      "description": "Rat and Snake both prefer to think before they speak and value discretion. Rat monitors the outer situation—money, logistics, deals—while Snake reads motives and long-term patterns. This can be a quietly effective team that rarely gets caught off guard. Problems appear when caution turns into secrecy and tests; it works best when you agree on what must always be honest, no matter what."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rat × Horse — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Freedom versus security",
      "description": "Rat and Horse form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash with a clear lifestyle gap. Horse wants movement, adventure, and room to change plans; Rat wants stability, savings, and predictability. At first, Rat admires Horse's courage and Horse enjoys Rat's cleverness. Over time, Rat can feel exposed by constant change, and Horse feels fenced in by constant caution. You need hard agreements about finances and freedom for this to last."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Goat — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Security versus ease",
      "description": "Rat and Goat form a Liu Hai (六害) pair where your fears rub. Rat worries about the future and being caught unprepared; Goat worries about rejection, scarcity, and emotional safety. Rat may see Goat as impractical or too focused on feelings; Goat may feel judged or tightened by Rat's constant risk focus. Clear budgets, basic structure, and regular reassurance on both sides are mandatory."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rat × Monkey — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Fast, clever partnership",
      "description": "Rat and Monkey complete the San He (三合) Visionary trine. Monkey brings humour, ideas, and agile problem-solving; Rat brings structure, realism, and strong follow-through when motivated. You spot chances early and can turn some into real gains, in love, money, or projects. This pairing shines when you choose a few priorities and actually finish them instead of living in endless schemes."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Standards and adjustments",
      "description": "Rooster likes clear rules and visible order; Rat prefers flexible plans and quiet work-arounds. At best, Rooster sets standards and Rat finds practical ways to meet them; at worst, Rooster's critiques make Rat evasive, and Rat's side-steps look dishonest. Agreeing who decides what, and how feedback is given, keeps this fair and functional."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dog — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Principle meets pragmatism",
      "description": "Dog cares about loyalty and doing what feels right; Rat cares about what will actually work and keep you safe. Dog can stop Rat from crossing ethical lines for convenience; Rat can stop Dog from sacrificing your stability out of pure idealism. Clashes come when Dog judges Rat's survival moves or Rat dismisses Dog's concerns as naïve. Regular, grounded talks about money, promises, and limits are key."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rat × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Care and caution under one roof",
      "description": "Pig is open-hearted, generous, and comfort-seeking; Rat is cautious, alert, and future-oriented. Pig makes Rat's life warmer and more forgiving; Rat protects Pig from being taken advantage of and keeps plans realistic. It turns sour if Pig feels constantly monitored or Rat feels forced into the \"serious one\" role forever. Shared priorities—what you may enjoy freely, what you must save for—keep this steady."
    }
  },
  "ox": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rat — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Steady builder, sharp planner",
      "description": "Ox and Rat form a Liu He (六合) pair that's practical and quietly powerful. Ox brings stamina, loyalty, and slow, consistent effort; Rat brings good timing, negotiation skills, and an eye for both risk and opportunity. Together you're well suited to building a home, business, or savings over time. It strains if Ox feels rushed or Rat feels their warnings are ignored."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Ox × Ox — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Shared grind, shared duty",
      "description": "Two Ox together take commitments seriously and usually stick things out through hard times. You can build something solid—a home, business, or family base—through steady effort. The weak points are stubbornness and emotional reserve; neither likes admitting mistakes or vulnerability. Making space for affection and shared fun, not only duty, keeps this from feeling like endless work."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Ox × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Slow earth, fast fire",
      "description": "Ox moves slowly and carefully; Tiger leaps and adjusts mid-air. Ox can keep Tiger from burning energy on unrealistic moves; Tiger can keep Ox from getting stuck in a rut. Friction builds if Tiger feels blocked and Ox feels attacked or disrespected. Clear agreements around money, tempo, and big decisions are vital."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rabbit — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet care",
      "description": "Ox offers reliability, patience, and physical steadiness; Rabbit brings tact, charm, and awareness of subtle moods. Together you can build a peaceful, home-centred life if loyalty and simplicity matter to you both. Problems appear when Rabbit feels emotionally overlooked or Ox feels drained by what they see as constant worry."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dragon — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Ground versus glory",
      "description": "Dragon pushes for big outcomes and visibility; Ox wants the basics secure and done properly. Ox can turn Dragon's big ideas into something concrete; Dragon can lift Ox's sights beyond mere survival. It goes wrong if Dragon dismisses Ox as boring or Ox sees Dragon as reckless and self-involved."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Ox × Snake — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Patient strategists",
      "description": "Ox and Snake share the San He (三合) \"Strategist\" trine. Ox brings endurance, loyalty, and persistence; Snake contributes insight, timing, and careful analysis. This combination suits long-range planning, financial discipline, and slow but meaningful progress. It thrives in privacy, with minimal outside interference."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Ox × Horse — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Routine versus restlessness",
      "description": "Ox and Horse form a Liu Hai (六害) pair. Ox likes routine, known responsibilities, and predictable finances; Horse prefers motion, variety, and freedom to change course. At first, Ox may admire Horse's spirit and Horse may enjoy Ox's steadiness. Over time, Ox can feel exhausted holding everything together, and Horse can feel tied down. Freedom and shared obligations must be clearly defined."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Goat — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Different needs, shared fatigue",
      "description": "Ox and Goat sit in a Liu Chong (六冲) clash and also share a punishment (刑) pattern, so effort and emotional needs can easily feel mismatched. Ox is task-oriented and shows love through work and reliability; Goat is feeling-oriented, expressive, and needs emotional reassurance and beauty. Done well, Ox protects Goat and Goat softens Ox. Done poorly, both feel unappreciated and worn out."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Ox × Monkey — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Structure and improvisation",
      "description": "Ox prefers clear plans and steady effort; Monkey likes options, shortcuts, and quick adjustments. Monkey can help Ox adapt to changing conditions and find smarter methods; Ox can help Monkey complete things and maintain stability. It strains when Ox labels Monkey unreliable or Monkey sees Ox as controlling and joyless."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rooster — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Work and standards",
      "description": "Ox and Rooster share the San He (三合) Strategist trine. Ox supplies patient effort and reliability; Rooster brings organisation, standards, and sharp attention to detail. Together you can manage work, money, and daily life efficiently. Remember to add warmth and praise so it doesn't become all critique and duty."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dog — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Duty versus worry",
      "description": "Ox and Dog belong to the same \"ungrateful punishment\" (刑) set, where both can feel their efforts aren't fully recognised. Ox focuses on carrying responsibilities and tangible tasks; Dog focuses on loyalty, ethics, and whether things feel fair. You can quietly achieve a lot if values and aims align, but if not, Ox may feel unfairly criticised and Dog may feel alone with their concerns. Open gratitude and explicit acknowledgment of each other's work are essential."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Ox × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Provider and comfort-seeker",
      "description": "Ox is willing to carry responsibility and work steadily; Pig values enjoyment, comfort, and emotional warmth. Ox can give Pig a stable base; Pig can help Ox relax, receive affection, and enjoy life more. It sours if Pig is seen as indulgent or Ox as unromantic and rigid. Shared simple pleasures and clear agreements about money keep this stable."
    }
  },
  "tiger": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Different tactics, shared courage",
      "description": "Tiger likes to move boldly and visibly; Rat prefers subtle planning and quiet advantage. At your best, Rat can help Tiger avoid obvious traps and manage resources, while Tiger helps Rat take decisive action instead of circling the same worries. The friction comes when Tiger feels second-guessed and Rat feels dragged into risk they did not sign up for. Clear roles—who calls the shots on money, who calls the shots on timing—keep this from turning into a power struggle."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Drive meets endurance",
      "description": "Tiger charges toward what feels right in the moment; Ox endures, step by step, regardless of mood. Ox can give Tiger the staying power and structure to see big moves through, while Tiger can stop Ox from wasting years in a situation that has already died. Stress appears when Tiger sees Ox as rigid or joyless, and Ox sees Tiger as disruptive or ungrateful. Agreeing on a few shared priorities, then letting each other handle them in your own style, makes this workable."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Tiger — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double fire, double will",
      "description": "Two Tigers together create a high-voltage connection full of passion, conviction, and a strong sense of justice. You usually recognise each other's courage and refusal to tolerate hypocrisy, which can feel validating and exciting. The risk is escalation: arguments, life changes, and decisions can all become bigger, faster, and more dramatic than they need to be. This match thrives when you channel your combined fire into shared causes and learn to step down instead of always needing the last, loudest move."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rabbit — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Bold protector, soft observer",
      "description": "Tiger moves directly and confronts problems; Rabbit prefers diplomacy, timing, and quiet adjustments. Tiger can give Rabbit a feeling of protection and permission to say \"no\" more often, while Rabbit helps Tiger avoid unnecessary fights and social damage. If it goes wrong, Rabbit experiences Tiger as loud or insensitive, and Tiger experiences Rabbit as evasive or passive-aggressive. Naming feelings early and respecting Rabbit's need for gentler handling keeps the bond from fraying."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dragon — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two leaders, one story",
      "description": "Tiger and Dragon are both strong-willed and idealistic, with different flavours of authority. Tiger leads from moral instinct and personal courage; Dragon leads from charisma, vision, and a sense of destiny. At best, Tiger keeps Dragon honest and grounded in real ethics, while Dragon helps Tiger think bigger and use influence strategically. Rivalry over who \"owns\" the narrative or gets the spotlight is your biggest hazard, so shared missions and mutual praise matter a lot."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Snake — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Quiet tests, sharp reactions",
      "description": "Tiger and Snake form a Liu Hai (六害) harm pair and sit together in a classic \"bullying style\" punishment (刑) triangle with Monkey. Tiger is open, impulsive, and bold; Snake is controlled, observant, and slow to reveal their hand. Attraction can be intense, because each brings what the other lacks—raw courage versus deep strategy—but misunderstandings and power tensions come easily. This pairing demands careful listening and clear boundaries around secrets, jealousy, and control if it is going to stay constructive."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Horse — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Running mates",
      "description": "Tiger and Horse share the San He (三合) \"Adventurer\" trine, creating one of Tiger's most natural, high-energy alliances. Horse brings spontaneity, movement, and social ease; Tiger brings conviction, bravery, and the willingness to confront problems head-on. Together you're well suited to big life changes, travel, or bold career moves, as long as someone keeps basic commitments in sight. When handled badly, you can hype each other into reckless decisions; when handled well, you feel like true partners in motion."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Goat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Protection and sensitivity",
      "description": "Tiger often sees themselves as a protector or pioneer; Goat is more attuned to feelings, nuance, and atmosphere. Tiger can shield Goat from harsher realities and advocate when Goat is too tired or anxious to push back. Goat, in turn, can soften Tiger's edges and keep them aware of emotional consequences. The danger is Tiger brushing off Goat's sensitivities as weakness, or Goat quietly resenting Tiger's blunt style. Honest reassurance and small, consistent acts of care keep this gentle and strong."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Monkey — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Competitive spark, lesson-heavy",
      "description": "Tiger and Monkey form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash and also sit in the same \"bullying\" punishment (刑) triangle with Snake, so the chemistry is sharp, memorable, and full of tests. Tiger is bold, straightforward, and driven by instinct; Monkey is agile, witty, and driven by clever manoeuvres. You can excite and inspire each other, but you can also trigger pride, one-upmanship, and mind games if trust is low. This pairing works best when you treat each other as sparring partners with rules—clear limits, honest apologies, and no revenge plays."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Raw courage, sharp critique",
      "description": "Tiger pushes forward and prefers to act; Rooster evaluates, organises, and points out flaws. Rooster can help Tiger refine their plans and avoid obvious mistakes; Tiger can help Rooster stop over-analysing and actually take risks. Conflict appears when Rooster's corrections feel like constant criticism and Tiger's moves feel reckless or dismissive. Agreeing on when feedback is welcome—and when you just need support—keeps this more constructive than combative."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dog — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Principles and loyalty",
      "description": "Tiger and Dog share the San He (三合) \"Defender\" trine, uniting two signs that deeply care about justice and loyalty. Dog brings steadfast support, honesty, and a strong conscience; Tiger brings courage, initiative, and the willingness to confront threats. Together, you're good at standing up for each other and for shared values, especially under pressure. The main risks are burnout from always \"fighting the good fight\" and difficulty relaxing; building simple pleasures and downtime into your life keeps this bond warm, not just righteous."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Pig — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Soft landing for bold moves",
      "description": "Tiger and Pig form a Liu He (六合) secret-friend pattern, giving Tiger one of their safest, most supportive matches. Pig offers emotional warmth, generosity, and a forgiving presence that lets Tiger drop their guard; Tiger offers protection, direction, and the courage to handle what Pig would rather not face. Together you can create a life that feels both adventurous and emotionally nourishing. The main pitfall is Tiger taking Pig's kindness for granted and Pig not naming hurt until it spills over; honest, gentle conversations keep this quietly strong."
    }
  },
  "rabbit": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rat — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Soft surface, sharp friction",
      "description": "Rabbit prefers tact, timing, and keeping things smooth; Rat prefers direct strategy and quick, practical decisions. At best, Rat quietly protects Rabbit's interests and Rabbit keeps social and emotional waters calm. As a punishment (刑) pair, though, small breaches of courtesy or tone can sting and build up silently. This match only stays healthy if Rabbit names hurt instead of retreating, and Rat respects that \"how\" things are done matters as much as \"what\" gets done."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Gentle heart, steady hand",
      "description": "Rabbit is sensitive, observant, and focused on emotional climate; Ox is patient, grounded, and focused on tangible results. Ox can give Rabbit a sense of physical and financial safety, while Rabbit softens Ox's edges and brings warmth and charm into daily life. If it goes wrong, Rabbit feels emotionally overlooked, and Ox feels drained by what they see as needless worry. Clear routines plus simple, consistent affection keep this connection peaceful and reassuring for both."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet strategy, bold moves",
      "description": "Rabbit tends to avoid open confrontation, working with timing and subtle influence; Tiger prefers direct action and visible stands. Tiger can give Rabbit courage and protection, making it easier for Rabbit to hold boundaries and take risks. Rabbit can help Tiger avoid unnecessary conflicts and social fallout by reading the room better. Trouble comes when Rabbit experiences Tiger as loud or rough, and Tiger experiences Rabbit as evasive—stating needs calmly but plainly is key."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rabbit — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double sensitivity",
      "description": "Two Rabbits together create a soft, refined, and emotionally attuned partnership. You both care about harmony, kindness, and avoiding harshness, so the relationship can feel safe and aesthetically pleasing. The challenge is indirectness: hurts and resentments can linger behind polite behaviour if nothing is said out loud. This match becomes quietly strong when you treat honesty as an act of care, not a threat to peace."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dragon — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Dream versus drive",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dragon form a Liu Hai (六害) harm pair where your styles easily step on each other. Dragon pushes boldly and likes decisive, sometimes dramatic moves; Rabbit prefers caution, diplomacy, and consideration of how everyone feels. Rabbit may feel swept aside or pressured; Dragon may feel blocked or \"talked down\" from momentum. This pairing only works if Dragon deliberately slows down for Rabbit's concerns and Rabbit meets Dragon halfway on bolder decisions."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Soft intuition, deep insight",
      "description": "Rabbit is gentle, responsive, and socially aware; Snake is private, analytical, and quietly intense. Both notice undercurrents, but Snake tends to probe while Rabbit tends to soothe. Together you can be very perceptive about people and timing, especially if there is space for quiet and retreat. It becomes uneasy if Snake's reserve makes Rabbit anxious, or Rabbit's need for reassurance feels like pressure—explicit reassurance and trust agreements help a lot."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Horse — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Comfort versus change",
      "description": "Rabbit seeks security, familiar comforts, and emotionally safe environments; Horse seeks movement, stimulation, and fresh experiences. At best, Horse introduces Rabbit to new horizons and stops life from becoming too narrow, while Rabbit provides a gentle landing place and emotional continuity. Over time, though, Rabbit can feel unsettled by constant change, and Horse can feel tied down by Rabbit's caution. Negotiating clear boundaries around travel, spending, and quiet time is essential."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Goat — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Shared softness, shared style",
      "description": "Rabbit and Goat share the San He (三合) \"Artist\" trine, making this one of Rabbit's most natural and comforting matches. Both value beauty, kindness, and emotional sensitivity, and you usually agree on what feels \"too harsh\" in people or environments. Goat brings creativity and emotional expressiveness; Rabbit brings social finesse and refined judgement. The main risk is avoidance of hard decisions—agreements about money, work, and boundaries keep this from drifting."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Monkey — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Calm presence, quick wit",
      "description": "Rabbit prefers gentle, measured moves; Monkey likes mental play, experiments, and quick shifts of plan. Monkey can lift Rabbit's mood, introduce new ideas, and help negotiate tricky situations; Rabbit can stabilise Monkey's life and offer a calming, accepting presence. Problems appear when Monkey's teasing hits Rabbit's sore spots, or Rabbit's quiet disapproval makes Monkey feel judged. It works best when humour is kind and both sides take each other's sensitivities seriously."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rooster — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Critique versus grace",
      "description": "Rabbit and Rooster form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash with very different approaches to truth and standards. Rooster values direct correction, clarity, and visible order; Rabbit values tact, subtlety, and emotional safety. Rooster may see Rabbit as vague or avoidant; Rabbit may see Rooster as harsh or embarrassing in public. This match demands strict rules around tone and timing of criticism; when handled skilfully, you can combine accuracy with kindness."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dog — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Trusted ally",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dog form a Liu He (六合) secret-friend pair that feels quietly safe and loyal. Dog brings honesty, moral backbone, and willingness to stand up when something is wrong; Rabbit brings tact, warmth, and emotional nuance. You tend to protect each other's vulnerabilities and share a dislike of cruelty or unfairness. This partnership deepens when Dog learns to soften delivery and Rabbit learns to speak directly, so care and truth travel together."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Pig — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Comfort and kindness",
      "description": "Rabbit and Pig share the San He (三合) Artist trine, creating a gentle, affectionate, and often very cosy connection. Pig brings generosity, emotional openness, and enjoyment of life's pleasures; Rabbit brings elegance, awareness of atmosphere, and a knack for smoothing rough edges. Together you're good at creating a home or relationship that feels safe and inviting. The challenge is over-indulgence and conflict avoidance—talking about boundaries and finances early keeps this sweet and sustainable."
    }
  },
  "dragon": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Rat — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Ambition with timing",
      "description": "Dragon and Rat share the San He (三合) \"Visionary\" trine, making this one of Dragon's most effective alliances. Dragon brings charisma, bold moves, and a big-picture push; Rat brings timing, negotiation skill, and careful handling of resources. Together you're good at turning big ideas into real wins, especially in career or shared projects. Friction appears when Dragon sees Rat as too cautious or suspicious, and Rat sees Dragon as grandiose or careless with risk. Regular, practical check-ins about money and pacing keep this powerful and sustainable."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Drive meets duty",
      "description": "Dragon wants to move toward big outcomes and visible achievements; Ox wants to fulfil responsibilities methodically and without drama. Ox can give Dragon a grounded base, consistent effort, and loyalty when times get hard. Dragon can help Ox aim higher, seize rare chances, and avoid wasting years on something that no longer has life. Problems come when Dragon treats Ox's caution as resistance, or Ox quietly resents Dragon's appetite for change—explicit agreements about direction and pace are crucial."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two alphas, one sky",
      "description": "Dragon and Tiger are both strong-willed, proud, and action-oriented, but their style is different. Tiger follows instinct and moral feeling in the moment; Dragon follows vision and a sense of dramatic timing. At best, Tiger keeps Dragon honest and brave, while Dragon helps Tiger think strategically and play a longer game. Rivalry over leadership, recognition, or whose \"truth\" wins can drain you both. This match works when you consciously choose shared missions and agree to back each other publicly instead of competing."

You may feel that you've finally met someone who understands big visions, big feelings, and big risks, which can be intoxicating. But as a self-punishment (自刑) pairing, the same intensity can turn inward—expectations rise, drama escalates, and neither wants to be the one who backs down or admits fault. This match becomes powerful when you share responsibility, use humour to deflate ego clashes, and agree that being kind matters more than being right."
