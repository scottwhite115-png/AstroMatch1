  "rat": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rat — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Quick minds, shared instincts",
      "description": "Two Rats together notice everything: shifts in mood, money, and opportunity. You are good at adapting, saving when needed, and acting early when something looks promising. The stress comes from worry and subtle competition over control, work, or money. This match works when you agree clearly on goals and treat each other as partners, not rivals."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rat × Ox — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Quietly strong team",
      "description": "Rat and Ox form a Liu He (六合) bond known for reliability. Ox brings patience and steady effort; Rat brings timing, ideas, and an eye for risk. Together you are well suited to building a home, business, or savings base over time. Respecting Ox's slower pace and trusting Rat's sense of when to move keeps this pairing very solid."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rat × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Different tempo, shared drive",
      "description": "Rat plans and calculates; Tiger jumps and leads. Rat can help Tiger avoid obvious mistakes, while Tiger stops Rat from getting stuck in overthinking. Friction shows up when Rat quietly judges Tiger as reckless or Tiger feels Rat is negative or controlling. It works best when you divide decisions clearly and accept that you approach risk differently."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rabbit — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Soft nerves, sharp edges",
      "description": "Rat and Rabbit sit in a punishment (刑) relation where small hurts can slowly build. Rat is more direct and tactical; Rabbit is sensitive and avoids heavy conflict. At your best, Rat protects and organises while Rabbit keeps the atmosphere gentle and civil. At your worst, Rabbit swallows hurt and withdraws, and Rat feels blocked without knowing why."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dragon — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Vision plus timing",
      "description": "Rat and Dragon share the San He (三合) \"Visionary\" trine. Dragon brings confidence, presence, and big goals; Rat brings careful timing, negotiation, and discipline with resources. This is one of Rat's strongest combinations for ambition and progress. It only really breaks when Dragon feels constantly second-guessed or Rat feels decisions are made for show, not substance."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rat × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet strategy, few words",
      "description": "Rat and Snake both like to think first and talk later. Rat tracks practical details; Snake reads people and long-term patterns. You can make a strong, discreet team that handles problems before they are visible to others. Just be careful that secrecy and \"testing\" do not replace straightforward conversation."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rat × Horse — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Freedom versus security",
      "description": "Rat and Horse form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash with a clear lifestyle gap. Horse wants movement, new experiences, and freedom; Rat wants stability, savings, and a plan. Early on, Rat admires Horse's spirit and Horse enjoys Rat's cleverness. Over time, Rat may feel exposed by constant change, while Horse feels fenced in by constant caution."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rat × Goat — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Security versus ease",
      "description": "Rat and Goat form a Liu Hai (六害) pair where needs quietly rub. Rat worries about money and the future; Goat worries about feeling safe, seen, and comfortable day to day. Rat can see Goat as impractical; Goat can feel judged or tightened up by Rat's focus on problems. Clear budgets and regular reassurance on both sides are essential."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rat × Monkey — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Sharp, playful, opportunistic",
      "description": "Rat and Monkey complete the San He (三合) Visionary trine. Monkey brings ideas, humour, and quick problem-solving; Rat brings structure, realism, and strong follow-through when motivated. You spot chances early and can turn some of them into real gains. The main risk is chasing too many schemes without finishing enough of them."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rat × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Standards and adjustments",
      "description": "Rooster likes clear rules and visible order; Rat prefers flexible plans and quiet work-arounds. At best, Rooster sets standards and Rat finds smart ways to meet them without wasting effort. At worst, Rooster's criticism makes Rat evasive, and Rat's side-steps look dishonest. Agreeing on who decides what, and how feedback is given, keeps things fair."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rat × Dog — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Principle meets pragmatism",
      "description": "Dog cares about what is right; Rat cares about what will actually work. Dog can stop Rat from crossing lines for convenience; Rat can stop Dog from sacrificing stability out of pure idealism. Clashes come when Dog judges Rat's survival moves or Rat dismisses Dog's concerns as naïve. Regular, practical talks about money and commitments help a lot."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rat × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Care and caution under one roof",
      "description": "Pig is open-hearted, generous, and pleasure-oriented; Rat is cautious, alert, and future-oriented. Pig makes Rat's life feel warmer and more forgiving; Rat protects Pig from being taken advantage of and keeps plans realistic. It turns sour if Pig feels constantly policed or Rat feels forced into the \"serious one\" role all the time. Clear shared priorities—what you are allowed to enjoy, what you are saving for—make this a much steadier match."
    }
  },
  "ox": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rat — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Steady builder, sharp planner",
      "description": "Ox and Rat form a Liu He (六合) pair that's practical and quietly powerful. Ox brings stamina, loyalty, and the willingness to do long, slow work; Rat brings timing, ideas, and a keen eye on risk and opportunity. Together you are well suited to paying off debts, building savings, or slowly improving your life circumstances. The match gets strained if Ox feels hustled or Rat feels their warnings are ignored."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Ox × Ox — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Shared grind, shared duty",
      "description": "Two Ox together take commitments seriously and are usually prepared to work through difficult periods without flinching. You are good at building something solid over time—property, a family base, or a business. The tension comes from stubbornness and emotional reserve; neither side likes to admit mistakes or vulnerability. Making space for affection and fun, not just duty, keeps this from feeling like a lifetime of chores."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Ox × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Slow earth, fast fire",
      "description": "Ox moves slowly and carefully; Tiger wants quick, decisive action. Ox can keep Tiger from leaping into unrealistic plans, while Tiger can prevent Ox from getting trapped in the same routine for years. Friction appears when Tiger feels blocked or nagged, and Ox feels pushed or disrespected. Clear agreements about tempo and money make this pair much easier to live in."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rabbit — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet care",
      "description": "Ox offers reliability, practical support, and a calm physical presence; Rabbit brings tact, grace, and awareness of moods and social cues. Together you can build a peaceful, home-centred life if you both value simplicity and loyalty. Problems develop when Rabbit feels emotionally overlooked or when Ox gets tired of what they see as endless worry or indecision."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dragon — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Ground versus glory",
      "description": "Dragon pushes for big outcomes and recognition; Ox is more concerned with whether the basics are covered and the work is done properly. Ox can turn Dragon's big ideas into something measurable and real; Dragon can lift Ox's sights beyond pure survival. It goes wrong if Dragon dismisses Ox as boring or Ox sees Dragon as reckless and self-centred."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Ox × Snake — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Measured and strategic",
      "description": "Ox and Snake share the San He (三合) Strategist trine. Ox brings patience, persistence, and a strong sense of duty; Snake contributes insight, timing, and a feel for hidden patterns. This combination is well suited for long-range planning, financial discipline, and slow but meaningful progress. It needs trust and privacy, not constant outside interference."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Ox × Horse — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Routine versus restlessness",
      "description": "Ox and Horse form a Liu Hai (六害) pair. Ox likes a set routine, known responsibilities, and predictable finances; Horse prefers motion, variety, and the freedom to change course. At first, Horse may enjoy Ox's grounded presence and Ox may admire Horse's spirit. Over time, Ox can feel drained trying to hold everything together, and Horse can feel tied down. You need strong agreements about freedom and shared obligations for this to work."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Ox × Goat — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Different needs, shared fatigue",
      "description": "Ox and Goat sit in a Liu Chong (六冲) clash and also share a \"punishment\" (刑) pattern, so effort and emotional needs can easily feel mismatched. Ox is task-oriented, stoic, and often shows love through work; Goat is feeling-oriented, expressive, and needs emotional reassurance. Ox can give Goat real-world stability; Goat can bring softness and creativity into Ox's life. If you stop appreciating each other, Ox feels taken for granted and Goat feels emotionally abandoned."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Ox × Monkey — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Structure and improvisation",
      "description": "Ox prefers clear plans and steady effort; Monkey likes options, experiments, and quick adjustments. Monkey can help Ox adapt to changing conditions, and Ox can help Monkey finish what they start. The match becomes difficult if Ox labels Monkey as unreliable, or Monkey sees Ox as controlling and joyless. A simple division of roles—who sets the plan, who tweaks it—goes a long way."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Ox × Rooster — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Work and standards",
      "description": "Ox and Rooster share the San He (三合) Strategist trine. Ox supplies grinding effort and endurance; Rooster contributes organisation, standards, and attention to detail. Together you can run a household or business efficiently and steadily. The main risk is a dry atmosphere—too much criticism, not enough warmth—so remembering to praise each other matters."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Ox × Dog — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Duty versus worry",
      "description": "Ox and Dog belong to the same \"ungrateful punishment\" (刑) set, where both can feel their efforts are not properly recognised. Ox focuses on carrying responsibilities and doing the hard work; Dog focuses on loyalty, ethics, and whether things feel right. You can quietly achieve a lot if values and goals line up, but if not, Ox may feel unfairly criticised and Dog may feel alone with their concerns. Naming mutual effort and gratitude clearly is essential."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Ox × Pig — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Provider and comfort-seeker",
      "description": "Ox is willing to carry responsibility; Pig wants comfort, enjoyment, and emotional warmth. Ox can give Pig a safe base and practical support; Pig can help Ox relax, receive affection, and actually enjoy the fruits of their labour. Issues arise if Pig is seen as indulgent or Ox as unromantic and rigid. Simple, shared pleasures and clear agreements about money keep this stable."
    }
  },
  "tiger": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Bold versus cautious",
      "description": "Tiger acts on impulse and courage; Rat plans, stores, and calculates. Tiger can pull Rat into bigger, more exciting moves; Rat can help Tiger avoid obvious pitfalls, especially around finances and timing. Tension comes when Tiger feels criticised or slowed down and Rat feels exposed by Tiger's risks. Respect for each other's role—Tiger for initiative, Rat for strategy—is essential."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Force meets resistance",
      "description": "Tiger wants to move quickly, test limits, and change course when necessary; Ox wants a clear lane and slow, steady progress. When you are aligned, Tiger opens new paths and Ox consolidates gains. When you are not, arguments repeat: Tiger feels fenced in, Ox feels under attack. Long-term, you must agree on which areas are \"go slow\" and which are \"go bold.\""
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Tiger — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double fire",
      "description": "Two Tigers together means strong will, emotional heat, and a low tolerance for feeling controlled. You understand each other's desire for freedom, passion, and straight talk, which can make the bond intense and alive. The downside is fierce conflict—neither side backs down easily. This match needs humour, space, and a few agreed rules about how far you let anger go."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rabbit — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Courage and tact",
      "description": "Tiger is direct and intense; Rabbit is gentle and conflict-averse. Tiger can stand up for Rabbit in hard situations and push life forward; Rabbit can soften Tiger's tone, smooth social situations, and tune in to emotional undercurrents. It fails when Tiger tramples Rabbit's feelings or Rabbit never actually says what they need, hoping Tiger will guess."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dragon — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two leaders, one story",
      "description": "Tiger and Dragon both like to lead and dislike being told what to do. Tiger brings raw courage and quick decisive moves; Dragon brings vision, charisma, and a sense of long-term mission. Together you can be impressive when you fight the same battles. At home, you need a clear division of territory so every conversation doesn't turn into a power contest."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Snake — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Complicated chemistry",
      "description": "Tiger and Snake form a Liu Hai (六害) pair with an added punishment (刑) link in the Tiger–Snake–Monkey group. Tiger is open and impulsive; Snake is guarded, observant, and slow to trust. Attraction can be real, but misunderstandings and control issues surface easily. Without a very high level of honesty and patience, this pairing tends to feel more draining than supportive."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Horse — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Running mates",
      "description": "Tiger and Horse share the San He (三合) Adventurer trine. Both value freedom, movement, and the sense that life is an adventure worth chasing. Tiger brings leadership and drive; Horse brings enthusiasm, social energy, and adaptability. This is one of Tiger's easiest matches as long as you respect each other's independence and don't try to cage the other."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Goat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Intensity and softness",
      "description": "Tiger's blunt, strong energy can feel like a lot for Goat's gentle, artistic temperament. Tiger can protect Goat and give them courage; Goat can offer Tiger emotional understanding and a softer home environment. If Tiger views Goat as overly fragile or Goat quietly resents Tiger's tone, resentment grows. Small acts of kindness and clear words from both sides keep this workable."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Monkey — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲) · Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Magnetic opposites",
      "description": "Tiger and Monkey form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash and also belong to the Tiger–Snake–Monkey punishment (刑) set. Tiger moves straight; Monkey moves sideways. The attraction is strong, with humour, competition, and drama, but so are ego clashes and sudden reversals. This pairing is vivid and memorable, but rarely calm; it takes unusual maturity to turn it into a lasting, stable bond."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Rooster — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Big moves, fine print",
      "description": "Tiger focuses on big actions and immediate results; Rooster focuses on details, methods, and doing things properly. Rooster can protect Tiger from obvious errors; Tiger can stop Rooster from getting paralysed by small imperfections. The match deteriorates if Rooster's critique feels constant or Tiger dismisses all feedback as nagging."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Dog — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Allies in action",
      "description": "Tiger and Dog share the San He (三合) Adventurer trine. Tiger brings initiative and daring; Dog brings loyalty, realism, and a strong moral compass. Dog will back Tiger in fights they believe are just, and Tiger will protect Dog fiercely. This is one of Tiger's best long-term matches when trust is honoured on both sides."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Tiger × Pig — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Soft landing for a fierce heart",
      "description": "Tiger and Pig form a Liu He (六合) pair. Tiger offers protection, heat, and forward motion; Pig offers acceptance, humour, and emotional warmth. Pig can make Tiger feel safe enough to relax; Tiger can help Pig feel defended in a tough world. Keeping an eye on spending and over-indulgence is usually the main joint task."
    }
  },
  "rabbit": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rat — Punishment Pattern (Xing 刑)",
      "tagline": "Sensitive to pressure",
      "description": "Rabbit and Rat sit in a punishment (刑) relationship where small frictions can quietly build. Rat is more direct and tactical; Rabbit is gentle, cautious, and conflict-shy. When handled well, Rat offers practical protection and planning, and Rabbit keeps the tone kind and social ties smooth. When ignored, Rabbit starts internalising hurt and Rat feels blocked by invisible resistance."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet stability",
      "description": "Ox brings reliability, effort, and a solid physical presence; Rabbit brings tact, charm, and awareness of emotional atmospheres. Together you can create a peaceful, modestly comfortable life if you both value loyalty and routine. Troubles appear when Rabbit feels emotionally neglected or Ox feels exhausted by what they see as constant worry and hesitation."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Heart and courage",
      "description": "Rabbit anticipates moods and subtle signals; Tiger acts on instinct and bravery. Rabbit can help Tiger avoid unnecessary conflict and read the room, while Tiger can stand up for Rabbit and push life forward when Rabbit is frozen by doubt. It breaks down if Tiger treats Rabbit's sensitivity as weakness or Rabbit never clearly voices their limits."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rabbit — Same Sign (同生肖)",
      "tagline": "Double sensitivity",
      "description": "Two Rabbits together create a soft, considerate atmosphere where open cruelty is rare. You are usually thoughtful about each other's feelings and home comfort. The main problem is avoidance—neither wants a difficult talk, so issues can be buried instead of solved. Treating honest conversation as an act of care, not hostility, makes this pairing much stronger."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dragon — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Soft versus strong",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dragon form a Liu Hai (六害) pair. Dragon is bold, pushy, and focused on big goals; Rabbit is understated, cautious, and tuned into nuance. Rabbit can feel overwhelmed or overridden; Dragon can feel stalled or misunderstood. When it works, Dragon uses their strength to shield, not push, and Rabbit offers grounded, tactful advice."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Quiet depth",
      "description": "Rabbit and Snake both dislike loud drama. Snake brings depth, analysis, and a careful, sometimes secretive way of moving; Rabbit brings warmth, politeness, and social awareness. This can be a refined, private bond. It suffers when Snake withdraws into silence and Rabbit guesses instead of asking, creating distance with no clear cause."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Horse — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Pace mismatch, shared goodwill",
      "description": "Horse likes activity, change, and speaking openly; Rabbit prefers calm, safety, and familiar surroundings. When balanced, Horse pulls Rabbit into new experiences, and Rabbit offers Horse a peaceful landing place. Over time, though, Rabbit can feel worn out by constant motion and Horse can feel contained. Planning both \"out days\" and \"home days\" helps."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Goat — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Gentle alliance",
      "description": "Rabbit and Goat share the San He (三合) Artist trine. Both value kindness, softness, and a pleasing environment. Goat adds creativity and emotional expression; Rabbit adds diplomacy and a steadying influence. This is one of Rabbit's most comfortable matches, as long as someone takes responsibility for practical matters."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Monkey — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Soft heart, quick wit",
      "description": "Monkey jokes, tests, and likes to keep things moving; Rabbit is more sensitive, observant, and easily affected by tone. Monkey can bring fun, variety, and useful ideas into Rabbit's world; Rabbit can offer emotional safety and a calming influence. The match frays when teasing cuts too deep or worries are never voiced. Clear limits around humour and honesty keep it healthy."
    },
    "rooster": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Rooster — Clash Pair (Liu Chong 六冲)",
      "tagline": "Critique versus sensitivity",
      "description": "Rabbit and Rooster sit in a Liu Chong (六冲) clash. Rooster is blunt, detail-focused, and quick to point out flaws; Rabbit is gentle, image-conscious, and conflict-averse. You can genuinely help each other—Rooster gives clarity and practicality, Rabbit teaches kindness and timing—but this requires real effort. Rules about how you argue and how far criticism goes are crucial."
    },
    "dog": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Dog — Secret Friend (Liu He 六合)",
      "tagline": "Safe harbour",
      "description": "Rabbit and Dog form a Liu He (六合) pair. Dog offers loyalty, protection, and a strong sense of right and wrong; Rabbit offers warmth, charm, and emotional nuance. This often feels like a place where both can drop their guard. Being transparent about fears, money, and outside friendships keeps this bond steady."
    },
    "pig": {
      "heading": "Rabbit × Pig — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Easy warmth",
      "description": "Rabbit and Pig share the San He (三合) Artist trine. Pig brings generosity, humour, and sensual enjoyment; Rabbit brings subtle care and social grace. The atmosphere is usually kind and forgiving. The main risk is drifting into comfort with no direction, so simple, shared goals help anchor the sweetness."
    }
  },
  "dragon": {
    "rat": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Rat — Same Trine (San He 三合)",
      "tagline": "Vision and timing",
      "description": "Dragon and Rat belong to the San He (三合) Visionary trine. Dragon brings confidence, presence, and daring ideas; Rat brings timing, negotiation skills, and control over resources. Together you are well positioned to build something meaningful or rise socially. Pride and secrecy are the main enemies—once trust cracks, the whole structure weakens."
    },
    "ox": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Ox — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Drive and steadiness",
      "description": "Dragon wants acceleration and visible progress; Ox wants security and careful, step-by-step work. Ox can keep Dragon's projects grounded; Dragon can help Ox reach beyond pure survival. Conflict appears when Dragon feels suffocated or Ox feels dragged into unnecessary risk. Agreeing on where you'll play safe and where you'll stretch helps a lot."
    },
    "tiger": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Tiger — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Two leaders, one stage",
      "description": "Dragon and Tiger are both strong personalities who like to lead. Dragon operates on vision and charisma; Tiger on courage and direct action. You can be a formidable team when you are on the same side. At home, though, you need clear areas of authority so every decision doesn't become a test of dominance."
    },
    "rabbit": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Rabbit — Six Harms (Liu Hai 六害)",
      "tagline": "Intensity and softness",
      "description": "Dragon and Rabbit form a Liu Hai (六害) pair. Dragon's blunt, forceful style can bruise Rabbit's finely tuned feelings; Rabbit's hesitation can frustrate Dragon. Still, Dragon can shield Rabbit in rough environments, and Rabbit can refine Dragon's approach and help with timing and presentation. Extra care in how you speak to each other is essential."
    },
    "dragon": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Dragon — Same Sign (同生肖) · Self-Punishment (自刑)",
      "tagline": "Magnified will",
      "description": "Two Dragons together double the charisma, pride, and sense of destiny. You may feel drawn to big goals and public roles, and you understand each other's desire to \"do something significant.\" The self-punishment (自刑) flavour shows up as internal pressure and stubborn stand-offs when expectations aren't met. Humility, humour, and equal sharing of power keep this from burning out."
    },
    "snake": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Snake — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Frontstage and backstage",
      "description": "Dragon prefers the front of stage; Snake prefers working from the shadows. Dragon pushes outward, selling the vision; Snake monitors patterns, risks, and timing. This can be a very effective \"executive plus strategist\" pairing. It sours when Dragon ignores Snake's input, or Snake reacts to that by withdrawing support instead of talking."
    },
    "horse": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Horse — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Charge ahead",
      "description": "Horse loves motion and immediate experience; Dragon focuses on big pushes and visible breakthroughs. Together you can move quickly, travel far, and bring a lot of energy to shared projects. The weak spot is follow-through—once the first rush fades, both can lose interest. Simple systems and deadlines help keep wins from evaporating."
    },
    "goat": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Goat — Neutral (中)",
      "tagline": "Strong arm, soft heart",
      "description": "Dragon's forceful, sometimes blunt style meets Goat's soft, artistic nature. Dragon can open doors, negotiate, and protect; Goat can soften the home atmosphere, add beauty, and offer emotional nuance. Problems appear if Dragon dismisses Goat's feelings as weakness or Goat quietly resists Dragon's plans without speaking up. Honest conversations about security and lifestyle are key."
    },
    "monkey": {
      "heading": "Dragon × Monkey — Same Trine (San He 三合)",

As a self-punishment (自刑) match, that critical eye can easily turn on yourselves and each other, so tension never quite relaxes. Regularly naming what you appreciate and consciously easing standards in private life keeps this sharp, capable bond humane."

Ox focuses on carrying responsibilities and doing the hard work; Dog focuses on loyalty, ethics, and whether things feel right. You can quietly achieve a lot if values and goals line up, but if not, Ox may feel unfairly criticised and Dog may feel alone with their concerns. Naming mutual effort and gratitude clearly is essential."

      "description": "Dog and Goat also sit in the \"ungrateful punishment\" (刑) group, so your shared concern can slip into mutual strain. Dog worries about loyalty and justice; Goat worries about belonging and emotional security. You understand each other's fears, but can end up feeling unappreciated or blamed. Deliberate positivity, clear appreciation, and practical plans—rather than just shared worry—keep this from becoming heavy."

      "description": "Two Aries together create a fast, direct, and high-energy connection. You push each other to act, try things, and be honest—sometimes brutally. The upside is momentum and passion; the downside is temper and pride. This pairing works when you learn to cool off, apologise quickly, and respect each other's need for independence."

      "description": "Aries wants movement and quick decisions; Taurus prefers to take time and secure the ground first. Aries can wake Taurus up and stop life from becoming stagnant, while Taurus can give Aries a stable base and help turn impulses into something lasting. It breaks down if Aries feels blocked at every turn or Taurus feels pushed and ignored. Clear agreements about money and pace are vital."

      "tagline": "Spark and talk",
      "description": "Aries brings initiative and courage; Gemini brings ideas, information, and flexibility. This can be a light, active, and socially busy match where plans change often and boredom is rare. Neither sign likes heavy emotional drama or long sulks, which helps. The weak spot is follow-through—lots starts, not everything finishes—so a bit of structure goes a long way."

      "tagline": "Heat and tide",
      "description": "Aries moves quickly and speaks plainly; Cancer feels deeply and reacts to tone as much as content. Aries can help Cancer be bolder and less stuck in old hurts; Cancer can teach Aries to slow down, listen, and actually process feelings. If Aries dismisses emotion as \"overreacting\" or Cancer clings and guilt-trips, both feel unsafe. You need strong boundaries and real patience for this to work long-term."

      "description": "Aries and Leo together create a confident, dramatic pairing. Aries brings raw drive and willingness to start; Leo brings warmth, loyalty, and a taste for doing things in style. You energise each other and tend to make bold moves when aligned. Problems come when ego wounds pile up—jealousy, competition for attention, or feeling under-appreciated. Regular, genuine praise on both sides keeps this strong."

      "description": "Aries wants to move fast; Virgo wants to get it right. Virgo can help Aries refine plans, avoid obvious mistakes, and take better care of daily details; Aries can stop Virgo from getting stuck in worry or analysis. It turns sour if Virgo slides into constant criticism or Aries refuses to listen to any feedback. Agreeing on where detail matters and where it doesn't is crucial."

Aries is about action, directness, and \"I\"; Libra is about balance, diplomacy, and \"we.\" The attraction can be strong, as each has what the other lacks: Aries provides decisiveness; Libra provides perspective and social skill. The tension shows up around conflict—Aries pushes, Libra negotiates or retreats. This works when decisions are shared and neither side is forced into a role they resent."

      "tagline": "Surface heat, deep currents",
      "description": "Aries is direct and explosive; Scorpio is controlled on the surface but intense underneath. Both are strong-willed and dislike feeling weak, which makes for powerful chemistry and serious fights. Aries can bring issues into the open; Scorpio can bring depth and focus. It becomes destructive if anger turns into revenge or endless tests. Clean honesty and clear lines around trust are mandatory."

      "description": "Aries and Sagittarius together create a very active, forward-moving match. Aries has the push to start; Sagittarius has the appetite for exploration, travel, and big ideas. You are likely to share humour and dislike heavy routines or emotional stagnation. The risk is restlessness and a tendency to avoid hard, boring work. Shared goals and at least a simple plan keep this from just being chaos with good stories."

Capricorn can help Aries channel raw drive into something that actually pays off; Aries can help Capricorn act sooner and not over-delay moves out of caution. Power struggles are common if Aries resents Capricorn's authority or Capricorn sees Aries as reckless. This match is strongest when you agree on a shared mission and clear roles."

      "description": "Aries brings courage and willingness to act; Aquarius brings perspective, ideas, and a taste for doing things differently. Both value freedom and dislike petty control, which can make this feel like a \"partners in crime\" vibe. Emotions may be handled more via logic and humour than tears. The main risk is detachment—someone has to remember to check in on feelings, not just plans and principles."

      "description": "Aries is clear, fast, and openly assertive; Pisces is sensitive, impressionistic, and often indirect. Aries can give Pisces backbone and help them set boundaries; Pisces can soften Aries, expand empathy, and open intuitive, creative channels. If Aries steamrolls Pisces' feelings or Pisces avoids direct talks altogether, confusion and hurt build quickly. You need extra clarity around expectations, time, and money for this to stay balanced."

      "description": "Taurus likes to move slowly and secure what they have; Aries wants speed and immediate action. Taurus can give Aries stability, loyalty, and practical follow-through, while Aries pushes Taurus out of ruts and into new experiences. It breaks when Taurus feels bulldozed and Aries feels blocked at every turn."

      "description": "Two Taureans together create a relationship built around security, routine, and physical comfort. You usually value loyalty, decent food, and a dependable home life.

Taurus seeks physical and financial security; Scorpio seeks emotional and psychological depth. You can form a powerful, loyal bond that does not rattle easily.

Taurus can help Sagittarius actually land ideas and build something lasting; Sagittarius can stop Taurus from living the same year on repeat. The match strains if Taurus tries to clip Sagittarius' wings or Sagittarius treats Taurus' need for stability as a joke."

      "description": "Taurus often trusts what is proven; Aquarius wants to try what is new or unconventional. Taurus can make Aquarius' ideas workable in the real world; Aquarius can widen Taurus' outlook and challenge fixed assumptions.
