                <p>
                  Pigs (or Boars) are sincere, kind, and generous. They value honesty and comfort, enjoying good food, friends, and peaceful surroundings. They are patient listeners and dislike conflict or deceit. Their optimism and tolerance make them well-liked. They can be naive at times, assuming others share their good intentions. Their strength lies in perseverance and compassion — they rarely give up on people or projects they believe in.

                <p>
                  Pigs are loving, faithful, and patient in relationships. They give deeply and expect the same sincerity in return. They crave warmth and harmony, avoiding unnecessary drama. They are most compatible with Rabbit and Goat, who share their emotional gentleness. Their lesson in love is discernment — learning that kindness needs boundaries to remain healthy.

              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  Pigs excel in caring, creative, and community-oriented fields: hospitality, healthcare, teaching, art, philanthropy, or human resources. They work best in cooperative, stable environments. They lead through empathy rather than authority. Financially, they're often lucky when they trust their instincts. When confident, they become beloved figures who uplift others through generosity and patience.

                    Rat and Pig create a gentle, supportive connection when both honour each other's emotional pace. Pig brings sincerity and warmth; Rat brings structure and inventive thinking.

                    Pig and Snake form a Liu Chong (六冲) clash, where emotional expression and priorities differ sharply. Snake's reserve may confuse Pig's openness, while Pig's vulnerability can overwhelm Snake's inward style. This match needs clear boundaries and emotional transparency. Without them, misunderstandings escalate quickly.

With respect for each other's needs, the connection feels wholesome and uplifting. Patience helps this pairing become steady and supportive.

                    Pig values warmth and emotional steadiness, while Monkey moves quickly and unpredictably. Their rhythms differ, creating misunderstandings if not managed gently. Pig may feel unsettled; Monkey may feel restricted. With patience, the match stays friendly, but it remains a delicate pairing overall.

                    Rooster's directness blends surprisingly well with Pig's warmth and sincerity when both communicate gently. Pig softens Rooster's rigidity; Rooster adds structure that strengthens Pig's confidence. Though not a classical harmony, the relationship becomes emotionally supportive with patience.

                    Pig brings empathy and emotional softness; Dog brings loyalty and grounded reassurance. This pairing feels kind, safe, and mutually supportive even without San He or Liu He alignment. Pig calms Dog's internal tension, while Dog protects Pig's sensitive nature. The bond grows through warmth and steady honesty.

                    Two Pigs create a nurturing, compassionate connection filled with generosity and emotional sincerity. But as a self-punishment Xing (相刑) pairing, shared softness can lead to avoidance or emotional overwhelm. Healthy boundaries and open communication keep the match balanced. When aligned, this becomes a deeply loving and comforting partnership.
