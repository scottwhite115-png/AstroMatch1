                Core Personality
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  The Ox is steady, loyal, and grounded — a symbol of endurance and reliability. Practical and conservative, they approach life methodically, preferring consistency over risk. They dislike chaos and believe slow, careful effort produces the best results. Their calm temperament hides quiet strength and determination. Oxen rarely seek the spotlight, but when they commit, they persevere until success is achieved. They value honesty, structure, and personal responsibility. Their challenge lies in flexibility: learning that change and vulnerability do not equal weakness.

              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  In relationships, the Ox is loyal, protective, and patient. They show love through stability and service rather than words. They appreciate loyalty, sincerity, and shared values. They can be shy at first but deeply faithful once committed. They are attracted to kind, grounded people who don't thrive on drama. Impulsive or unreliable partners drain them. Best matches include Rat and Snake, who respect their consistency. Their love lesson is to communicate openly rather than bottling emotions for the sake of peace.

              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  Oxen excel in careers requiring discipline and endurance: engineering, construction, banking, agriculture, administration, law, or management. They build trust through steady work and integrity. They thrive in structured environments with clear expectations. Their work ethic can make them indispensable, but they must guard against burnout and over-responsibility. When they combine patience with adaptability, they become the pillars others depend on.
