                Core Personality
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  Rats are clever, quick-thinking, and resourceful — born strategists who can see opportunity in chaos. Their energy is alert, flexible, and observant; they're rarely caught unprepared. Charming and witty, Rats are natural communicators who can adapt to any crowd while quietly assessing motives and odds. They like comfort and security yet are also ambitious, always planning the next step ahead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Their Water nature makes them intuitive and emotionally perceptive, but also prone to nervous tension when juggling too many priorities. They value intellect, humour, and efficiency, often preferring subtle influence to overt confrontation. Beneath their sociable exterior lies a calculating mind that thrives on information, networks, and contingency plans.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 className={`text-xl font-bold mb-3 ${theme === "light" ? "text-gray-900" : "text-white"}`}>
                Relationships
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  In relationships, the Rat is lively, affectionate, and surprisingly romantic when trust is earned. They enjoy playful banter, shared curiosity, and mental connection. Loyalty matters, but so does mental stimulation — they need partners who keep conversation flowing and life interesting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At times they can be possessive or controlling if security feels threatened, but they are also generous when loved well. Rats tend to attract ambitious or witty partners who mirror their sharpness. They match best with Dragon and Monkey (same Trine) for shared optimism and pace, and with Ox for steadiness and grounding. Their lesson in love is to balance calculation with vulnerability — to trust that emotional honesty can create the stability they crave.

                Career & Life Path
              </h2>
              <div className="space-y-3">
                <p>
                  Rats excel in environments where intelligence, adaptability, and social skill matter. They're quick learners and persuasive communicators — excellent in business, marketing, politics, finance, journalism, or tech. They manage resources wisely and often climb ladders early through strategic alliances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They dislike waste and inefficiency, preferring merit-based systems that reward initiative. As leaders, they're pragmatic and attentive to detail, though they must guard against micromanaging. Their financial instincts are strong, and they often build security through multiple ventures or investments. When balanced, the Rat becomes a visionary strategist — smart, creative, and quietly powerful.
