# ✅ AAB Uploaded! What Happens Next

## What You Just Did

✅ Uploaded AAB to Closed Testing track  
✅ Saved the release  
✅ Submitted for review  

## What Happens Now

### 1. Google Play Review (Usually 1-3 hours)
- Google will review your AAB
- They check for policy compliance, security, etc.
- Usually takes 1-3 hours, sometimes up to 24 hours
- You'll get an email when it's approved

### 2. After Approval
- The new version (1.0.2) will be available to testers
- Testers will see an update notification in Google Play
- They can download the new version

### 3. Testers Can Test
- Testers should download the update from Google Play
- They'll get version 1.0.2 with the OAuth fix
- They can test Google sign-in and verify it works in-app

## What to Tell Your Testers

Once the release is approved, tell your testers:

```
Hi! The new version (1.0.2) is now available with the OAuth fix.

Please:
1. Open Google Play Store
2. Go to "My apps & games"
3. Find AstroMatch and update it
4. Test Google sign-in - it should now work within the app instead of opening Chrome
5. Let me know if it works correctly!

The fix:
- OAuth opens in in-app browser (not external Chrome)
- Automatically returns to app after sign-in
- No longer gets stuck in Chrome
```

## How to Check Review Status

1. Go to: https://play.google.com/console
2. Select **AstroMatch**
3. Go to **Testing → Closed testing**
4. Look at your release - it will show:
   - "Under review" (waiting)
   - "Available to testers" (approved!)
   - "Rejected" (if there's an issue - rare)

## What to Watch For

### ✅ Good Signs:
- Release shows "Available to testers"
- No rejection email
- Testers can download the update

### ⚠️ If Rejected:
- You'll get an email with reasons
- Usually fixable (wrong version, missing info, etc.)
- Let me know and we'll fix it

## Expected Timeline

- **Review**: 1-3 hours (sometimes up to 24 hours)
- **After approval**: Testers can download immediately
- **Testing**: Testers should test within a few days

## Success Checklist

- [x] AAB uploaded
- [x] Release saved
- [x] Submitted for review
- [ ] Review approved (waiting...)
- [ ] Testers notified
- [ ] Testers download update
- [ ] OAuth fix verified working

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for approval** (check Play Console in a few hours)
2. **Notify testers** once it's approved
3. **Ask testers to verify**:
   - Google sign-in opens in-app browser
   - Returns to app after sign-in
   - Not stuck in Chrome
   - Successfully logs in

## If Testers Still Report Issues

If testers still see the Chrome issue:
1. Make sure they downloaded the update (version 1.0.2)
2. They might need to clear app data and try again
3. Check if they're testing the right version
4. Let me know and we can troubleshoot
