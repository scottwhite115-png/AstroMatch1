# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress

## Task List Creation

1. Create task lists in a markdown file (in the project root):
   - Use `TASKS.md` or a descriptive name relevant to the feature (e.g., `ASSISTANT_CHAT.md`)
   - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

2. Structure the file with these sections:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name Implementation
   
   Brief description of the feature and its purpose.
   
   ## Completed Tasks
   
   - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
   - [x] Task 2 that has been completed
   
   ## In Progress Tasks
   
   - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
   - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon
   
   ## Future Tasks
   
   - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
   - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation
   
   ## Implementation Plan
   
   Detailed description of how the feature will be implemented.
   
   ### Relevant Files
   
   - path/to/file1.ts - Description of purpose
   - path/to/file2.ts - Description of purpose
   ```

## Task List Maintenance

1. Update the task list as you progress:
   - Mark tasks as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Add new tasks as they are identified
   - Move tasks between sections as appropriate

2. Keep "Relevant Files" section updated with:
   - File paths that have been created or modified
   - Brief descriptions of each file's purpose
   - Status indicators (e.g., ✅) for completed components

3. Add implementation details:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Data flow descriptions
   - Technical components needed
   - Environment configuration

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI should:

1. Regularly update the task list file after implementing significant components
2. Mark completed tasks with [x] when finished
3. Add new tasks discovered during implementation
4. Maintain the "Relevant Files" section with accurate file paths and descriptions
5. Document implementation details, especially for complex features
6. When implementing tasks one by one, first check which task to implement next
7. After implementing a task, update the file to reflect progress

## Example Task Update

When updating a task from "In Progress" to "Completed":

```markdown
## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Implement database schema
- [ ] Create API endpoints for data access

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment variables
```

Should become:

```markdown
## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Create API endpoints for data access

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Implement database schema
```

## AstroMatch Specific Examples

### Authentication Implementation Tasks
```markdown
# Authentication System Implementation

Implementing user authentication with Supabase for AstroMatch.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up Supabase project
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Install Supabase client

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Build login screen with OAuth providers
- [ ] Implement email magic link authentication

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add user profile creation flow
- [ ] Implement session management
- [ ] Add logout functionality

## Implementation Plan

The authentication system will use Supabase Auth with support for:
- Google OAuth
- Facebook OAuth  
- Apple OAuth
- Email magic links

### Relevant Files

- src/lib/supabaseClient.ts - Supabase client configuration
- src/app/auth/login/page.tsx - Login screen component
- src/app/auth/callback/route.ts - OAuth callback handler
```

### Matching Engine Implementation Tasks
```markdown
# Matching Engine Implementation

Building the astrological compatibility matching system.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create compatibility engine structure
- [x] Implement sign helper functions
- [x] Set up basic compatibility calculations

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Populate 144x144 compatibility matrix
- [ ] Test compatibility calculations
- [ ] Optimize performance for real-time matching

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add distance-based filtering
- [ ] Implement preference matching
- [ ] Add compatibility insights generation

## Implementation Plan

The matching engine will calculate compatibility based on:
- Western zodiac signs (sun, moon, rising)
- Chinese zodiac animals
- Element and modality compatibility
- Geographic proximity

### Relevant Files

- src/lib/compatibility/engine.ts - Core compatibility calculations
- src/lib/compatibility/matrix.json - 144x144 compatibility data
- src/lib/compatibility/helpers.ts - Sign calculation utilities
```

### Discovery Feature Implementation Tasks
```markdown
# Discovery Feature Implementation

Building the swipeable card interface for finding matches.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Design card component structure
- [x] Set up basic swipe gestures

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Implement photo carousel
- [ ] Add overlay content system
- [ ] Create like/pass functionality

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Add 4-week cooldown system
- [ ] Implement distance filtering
- [ ] Add preference-based filtering

## Implementation Plan

The discovery feature will include:
- Swipeable card stack interface
- Photo carousel with 6 photos per user
- Overlay content that changes with photo index
- Like/pass gestures with haptic feedback

### Relevant Files

- src/components/discovery/CardStack.tsx - Main card component
- src/components/discovery/PhotoCarousel.tsx - Photo navigation
- src/components/discovery/OverlayContent.tsx - Dynamic overlays
- src/hooks/useDiscovery.ts - Discovery data management
```

## Best Practices

### Task Organization
- Group related tasks together
- Use clear, actionable task descriptions
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces
- Prioritize tasks by importance and dependencies

### Progress Tracking
- Update task status regularly
- Document decisions and changes
- Keep implementation details current
- Note any blockers or issues

### File Management
- Keep file paths accurate and up-to-date
- Add descriptions for each file's purpose
- Mark completed components with status indicators
- Include relevant configuration files

### Collaboration
- Use consistent formatting across task lists
- Include context for complex features
- Document architectural decisions
- Share progress updates clearly
