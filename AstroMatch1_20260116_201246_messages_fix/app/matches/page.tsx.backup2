// Test profiles with varied zodiac signs to show ALL match engine rankings
// These profiles work with the NEW 70/30 East/West match engine (computeMatch)
// User profile: Leo-Rabbit (default, loaded from localStorage if available)
// Each profile has westernSign and easternSign which are converted to UserProfile format
// NEW RULES (70/30 system with computeMatch):
// - Score ranges: 95-100 Soulmate Match, 85-94 Twin Flame Match, 75-84 Excellent Match, 60-74 Favourable Match, 50-59 Neutral Match, 35-49 Magnetic Opposites, 0-34 Difficult Match
// - Same West sign CANNOT be Soulmate/Twin Flame/Excellent (max is Favourable 60-74 or Neutral 50-59)
// - San He + strong West (same_element/compatible_element, NOT same_sign) = Soulmate (95+) or Twin Flame (88-94)
// - San He + semi/opposing West = Excellent (75+)
// - Liu He + strong West = Excellent (75+)
// - Liu He + semi/opposing = Favourable (60+)
// - Same animal/same trine + strong West = Excellent (75+)
// - Same animal/same trine + semi/opposing = Favourable (60+)
// - Liu Chong = Magnetic Opposites (35-49)
// - Neutral East pattern = Neutral Match (50-59)
// Profiles are enriched with tropical/sidereal signs calculated from birthdate
// Test profiles cover diverse match scenarios across the full Chinese zodiac cycle
// 24 profiles: 2 for each year from 1972-1983 (complete 12-year cycle), shuffled randomly
