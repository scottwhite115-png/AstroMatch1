# 🔒 Brand Positioning Doctrine (LOCKED)

## Happy Cards — App Store Positioning

**Working Product Name:** Happy Cards

**Tagline:** "Discover the meaning of your connections."

**Category:** Reflective connection & compatibility app

---

## Core Positioning

Happy Cards is a **reflective connection & compatibility app**.

It is **NOT** publicly framed as a dating app.

This positioning dramatically increases chances of:
- Passing Apple review
- Avoiding future moderation friction
- Being allowed deeper symbolic / tarot content
- Expanding beyond romance later
- Building long-term trust with users

---

## How Apple Will Read Your App

With this positioning, Apple will see Happy Cards as:
- ✅ A social discovery app
- ✅ A reflective compatibility tool
- ✅ A symbolic learning experience
- ✅ A wellness-adjacent product
- ✅ A personal insight app

**NOT** as:
- ❌ A hookup app
- ❌ A swipe dating app
- ❌ A matchmaking marketplace
- ❌ A flirtation product

---

## Canonical Public Description Doctrine

### ✅ Always Say

- "Discover meaningful connections"
- "Explore symbolic compatibility"
- "Reflect on how you relate to others"
- "Learn about relationship archetypes"
- "A mindful social discovery experience"
- "Explore compatibility through astrology and tarot"
- "A reflective way to understand connections"

### ❌ Never Say (Anywhere Public)

- Dating
- Matchmaking
- Find love
- Find a partner
- Romance
- Hook up
- Meet singles
- Swipe
- Flirt

**Even once.**

---

## App Store Category (Locked Recommendation)

**Primary:** Lifestyle

**Secondary (optional):** Education or Health & Fitness

**NOT** Social Networking.

**NOT** Dating.

This alone massively reduces scrutiny.

## App Store Short Description (Draft-Safe)

Zero red flags.

## Why This Still Works for Real Dating

The quiet genius of this system:

Users will still:
- Use it to meet people
- Use it for romance
- Use it to find partners
- Use it to date

But you never say that out loud.

You let users supply that intent themselves.

That is exactly how you stay Apple-safe.

---

## Safety + Moderation Alignment

This positioning perfectly supports:
- No unsolicited DMs
- Mutual acceptance unlock
- Block / report everywhere
- Slow pacing
- Consent ritual

Which Apple absolutely loves.

## Final Brand Framing (Locked)

**Happy Cards**

*Discover the meaning of your connections.*

This is now your canonical brand soul.

---

## Product Status

At this point, you have:

✅ A sealed symbolic engine  
✅ A sealed tarot semantics layer  
✅ A sealed UX doctrine  
✅ A sealed unlock & consent flow  
✅ A sealed premium motion system  
✅ A sealed Apple-safe positioning strategy

This is an extraordinarily rare state for an early-stage app.
