**Purpose:** Apple approval readiness + engineering sanity  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-XX

## 🟢 PART 1 — APP STORE LISTING COPY + SCREENSHOT DOCTRINE

Public positioning must exactly match onboarding tone and in-app behavior.

**This is now canonical.**

---

## 1) App Name (Locked)

**Happy Cards**

✅ **Status:** LOCKED  
✅ **No variations allowed**

---

## 2) Subtitle (Apple-Safe, High-Signal)

Choose one of these (all safe):

**Option A (cleanest):**
```
Reflect on the meaning of your connections
```

**Option B (slightly richer):**
```
Explore symbolic compatibility and connection meaning
```

**Option C (educational tone):**
```
Discover connection meaning through astrology and tarot
```

### ✅ Recommendation: Option A

**Rationale:**
- Lowest friction
- Zero red flags
- Aligns with "reflective connection & compatibility app" positioning

**LOCKED COPY:**

```

Happy Cards — Discover the Meaning of Your Connections
